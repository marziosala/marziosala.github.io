This site contains some experiments on artificial intelligence, machine learning, financial mathematics, in random order. The material is organized as blog posts, with the accompaining code in the GitHub repositories. As you can see, I like Python, and all the code is done in Jupyter notebooks. For more information about me check out my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marziosala); [this](/publications/) is instead the  list of publications during my years in academia.
