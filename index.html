<p>Welcome! This site contains some experiments on artificial intelligence,
machine learning, financial mathematics, in random order. The material is
organized as blog posts, with the accompaining code in the GitHub repositories.
</p>

<p>For more information about me check out the <a href='/publications/'>list</a>
of publications of my academic years.
</p>

<p>The <a href='/thesis/'>description</a> of my PhD thesis contains a few nice
visualization of the flow field around airplanes.</p>

<p>Over the years I've been involved in several open-source software projects, for which you can find a <a href='/projects/'>brief description</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, since I like traveling and photography, here you have a few nice pictures of mine.</p>
