In this article we continue the exploration of functional principal component analysis (FPCA) that we did [before](/fpca). We start by loooking deeper into [Mercer's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer%27s_theorem). The theorem states that every continuous, symmetric positive-definite function $K(x, y) : \Omega \times \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, with $\Omega \in \mathbb{R}^d$, can be expressed as an infinite sum of product functions,

$$
K(x, y) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \lambda_i \varphi_i(x) \varphi_i(y),
$$

where the $\lambda_i$ are non-negative eigenvalues and the $\varphi_i$ the corresponding eigenfunctions. The convergence is absolute and uniform.

The function $K(x, y)$, is called a **kernel function**, that is a function that is symmetric, $K(x, y) = K(y, x), \forall x, y \in \Omega$ and is positive definite, meaning that for any finite set of points $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_d \}$ and any real numbers $\{ c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n \}$, the inequality
$$
\sum_{i, j} c_i c_j K(x_i, x_j) \ge 0
$$
holds. This means that the [Gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_matrix) matrix $G \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ with elements $G_{i, j} = K(x_i, x_j)$ is symmetric positive definite.

Common examples of kernel functions are, $\forall x, y \in \Omega = \mathbb{R}^d$,
- the linear kernel $K(x, y) = x^T y$,
- the polynomial kernel $K(x, y) = (x^T y + c)^n$, with $r \ge 0, n\ge 1$, and
- the Gaussian kernel $K(x, y) = e^{ -\frac{\lVert x - y\rVert^2}{2 \sigma^2} }, \sigma > 0.$

As a simple example, we look at $\Omega = [a, b] \subset \mathbb{R}$ and $K(x, y) = f(x) f(y)$. An eigenfunction $\varphi(x)$ must satisfy

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_a^b K(x, y) \varphi(y) dy & = \lambda \varphi(x) \\
%
\int_a^b f(x) f(y) \varphi(y) dy & = \lambda \varphi(x) \\
%
f(x) \int_a^b f(y)\varphi(y) dy & = \lambda \varphi(x).
\end{aligned}
$$

Assuming $\lambda \neq 0$, we must have $\varphi(x) = \alpha f(x)$ for some $x \in \mathbb{R}$, and consequently

$$
f(x) \int_a^b f(y) \alpha f(y) dy = \lambda \alpha f(x)
$$

which yields

$$
\lambda = \int_a^b f(y)^2 dy.
$$

To get the normalized eigenfunctions, we need

$$
\int_a^b \alpha^2 f(y)^2 dy = 1,
$$

that is
$$
\alpha = \left(  \int_a^b f(y)^2 dy \right)^{-1/2}.
$$

It also follows that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\lambda \varphi(x) \varphi(y) & = \lambda \lambda^{-1/2} f(x) \lambda^{-1/2} f(y) \\
& = f(x) f(y) \\
& = K(x, y), 
\end{aligned}
$$

as expected from Mercer's theorem, since there is only one eigenvalue (and eigenfunction).

In the case $f(x) = x$, it is easy to see that

$$
\lambda = \int_a^b y^2 dy = \frac{1}{3}(b-a)^3
$$

and

$$
\alpha = \left( \int_a^b y^2 dy \right)^{-1/2} = \lambda^{-1/2}.
$$

Therefore,
$$
\varphi(x) = \lambda^{-1/2} x.
$$

After this small detour on Mercer's theorem, we go back to the [Karhunen-Lo√®ve Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosambi%E2%80%93Karhunen%E2%80%93Lo%C3%A8ve_theorem) introduced in the previous article, focusing on two-dimensional problems, that is $d=2$. We consider the sequence $\{ X_t, t=1, \ldots, T\}$ where each $X_t$ is a sample of an unknown function $X(t, x, y)$, that is given a set of sampling points $\{x_i, y_i, i=1, \ldots, I\},$ we have $X_t = \{X_{t, i} = z(t, x_i, y_i), i=1, \ldots, I\}$. For simplicity we assume $x, y \in \Omega = [-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]$, knowing that different domains can be easily mapped to $\Omega$.

The basis functions we will use are [Legendre polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials). Normalized Legendre polynomials of order $m$ are polynomials in the form

$$
\mathcal{L}_m(x) = \frac{\sqrt{2m + 1}}{2} \frac{1}{2^m m!} \frac{d^m}{dx^m (x^2 - 1)^m}
$$

that are orthogonal in the sense that

$$
\int_{-1}^1 \mathcal{L}_i(x) \mathcal{L}_j(x) dx = \delta_{ij},
$$

with $\delta_{ij}$ the [Kronecher delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_delta). Let's visualize those polynomials.


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('ggplot')
import numpy as np
from scipy.special import eval_legendre
```


```python
X = np.linspace(-1, 1)
```


```python
fig, axes = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10), nrows=4, ncols=4, sharex=True, sharey=True)
axes = axes.flatten()
for n, ax in zip(range(0, 16), axes):
    y = eval_legendre(n, X)
    ax.plot(X, y, label=r'$P_{}(x)$'.format(n))
    ax.set_title(f'n={n}', fontdict=dict(size=10))
fig.tight_layout()
```

To create basis functions for our two-dimensional case, wwe take the products of the first $n$ Legendre polynomials, such that the powers sums to at most $m$, with the first polynomial applied to $x$ and the second to $y$. Specifically, the basis functions $\psi(x, y)_i, i=0, \ldots, m$ are defined as

$$
\begin{aligned}
\psi_0(x, y) & = \mathcal{L}_0(x) \mathcal{L}_0(y) \\
\psi_1(x, y) & = \mathcal{L}_1(x) \mathcal{L}_0(y) \\
\psi_2(x, y) & = \mathcal{L}_0(x) \mathcal{L}_1(y)
\end{aligned}
$$

and so on. This gives a total of $B=\frac{1}{2}(n + 1)(n + 2)$ basis functions for any value of $m$. Becasue of the orthogonality discussed above, we have

$$
\int_{-1}^1 \int_{-1}^1 \psi_i(x, y) \psi_j(x, y) dx dx = \delta_{i, j}.
$$

It is worthwhile to visualize those basis functions, to appreciate their lack of smoothness as $m$ increases.


```python
func2d = lambda x, y, i, j: eval_legendre(i, x) / np.sqrt(2 / (2 * i + 1)) * eval_legendre(j,y) / np.sqrt( 2 / (2 * j + 1))
```


```python
n = 101
x = np.linspace(-1, 1, n)
y = np.linspace(-1, 1, n)
xx, yy = np.meshgrid(x, y)
```


```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 20))
counter = 0
m = 8
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(m):
        ax = fig.add_subplot(m, m, counter + 1, projection='3d')
        counter += 1
        zz = func2d(xx.flatten(), yy.flatten(), i, j).reshape(n, n)
        ax.plot_surface(xx, yy, zz, linewidth=0, antialiased=True)
        ax.axis('off')
fig.tight_layout()
```

The image above suggests that large values of $m$ may be unstable, as the polynomials have large oscillations, while moderate values of $m$ will produce smooth basis functions.

We can now project any given $X_t$ into the space spanned by our basis functions. The best approximation $\hat{X}_t$ is

$$
\hat X_t = \sum_{b=1}^B a_{t, b} \psi_b (x, y), \quad \quad \forall (x, y) \in \Omega = [-1, 1]^2,
$$

where the coefficients $a_{t, b}$ are estimated by minimizing the least square error,

$$
a_t = \argmin_{\alpha} \sum_{i=1}^B \left( X_{t, i} - \sum_{b=1}^B \alpha_b \psi_b(x_i, y_i) \right)^2.
$$
