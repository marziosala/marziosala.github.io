For "bad" questions (that is, the product does not exist), we generally get a warning that the question
is probably wrong, however for less-known companies and products we can get an answer that looks correct but is in reality completely wrong. In our example, while [supersonic toothbrushes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasonic_toothbrush) exist, there is no company named "The Great Goat Company" (several company names relate to "goat" however). A slightly simpler prompt would result in a more polished answer saying that such company cannot be found.

A slightly more involved query involves not only data but some reasoning, for example a proof of the
[Pythagorean theorem])https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem). (More advanced theorems will work much less well.)


```python

<font color='#880E4F'>The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry, discovered by the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras. It states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This can be written as:

`a² + b² = c²`

Where:
- `c` represents the length of the hypotenuse,
- `a` and `b` represent the lengths of the other two sides.

Here's a step-by-step proof of the Pythagorean theorem:

1. Start with a right-angled triangle and make a square on each side.

```
    c
    |\
    | \
    |  \
  b |   \ a
    |    \
    |     \
    |______\
       c
```

2. The total area of the square formed by `c` (the hypotenuse) is `c²`.

3. The total area of the squares formed by `a` and `b` are `a²` and `b²` respectively.

4. Now, rearrange the squares formed by `a` and `b` to fit into the square formed by `c`.

5. You'll notice that the squares formed by `a` and `b` perfectly fill up the square formed by `c`.

This visually demonstrates that `a² + b² = c²`, which is the Pythagorean theorem.</font>


What we have done so far is still quite classical -- we could just search using a classical search engine and reformat the results ourselves, or search for a page with the proof of the Pytagorean's theorem. A novel that is instead to summarize a text: given some content, we want a shorter version of it, possibly specified the number of words to be used. We test it here on a few Wikipedia articles on the short stories of [Anton Chekhov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Chekhov), which are also short pages and as such works well. There is a limit to the number of tokens for ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatPGT 4, so in general for longer pages we would need to ask ChatGPT to summarize each section, which in turns requires us to clearly identify the sessions. As our scope is not the scraping of Wikipedia text, we use the shorter pages of some of the most famous Chekhov's novels. The helper function `print_summary` takes in input the page name, downloads it using the nice `wikipedia` package, and uses a simple prompt to get a summary. The output is tested on seven pages and can be easily extended to many more.


```python
def print_summary(page):

<h4>The Bishop (short story)</h4><p>"The Bishop" is a 1902 short story by Anton Chekhov, first published in the April 1902 issue of Zhurnal Dlya Vsekh. The story, which reflects the psychological state of the author, is considered to be partly autobiographical. It tells the tale of the last days of a terminally ill priest. The story was written after Chekhov promised Viktor Mirolyubov to write a story for Zhurnal Dlya Vsekh. The story was delayed due to Chekhov's deteriorating health and was finally published in April 1902. The plot revolves around Pyotr, the Bishop at the Staro-Petrovski Convent, who is terminally ill. He sees a woman who looks like his mother in the crowd during a service, and later learns that his mother had indeed come to visit him. As his condition worsens, he becomes increasingly annoyed with the people around him and longs to be abroad. He eventually dies a day before Easter Sunday. A month later, a new bishop arrives and everyone forgets about Pyotr. The story was well-received by the contemporary Russian press, with several critics praising its artistic merits and insightful depiction of a Russian clergyman's life.
</p>



<h4>Ionych</h4><p>"Ionych" is a short story written by Anton Chekhov in 1898. The story was first published in the September 1898 issue of the Monthly Literary Supplements to Niva magazine. The plot revolves around Doctor Dmitry Ionovich Startsev, who moves to a provincial town to work for the local zemstvo. He becomes acquainted with the Turkin family, who are considered the pride of the town. Startsev falls in love with the Turkin's daughter, Ekaterina, but she rejects his proposal to focus on her musical ambitions. Years later, Startsev is a respected and wealthy doctor, while Ekaterina has abandoned her musical dreams. She attempts to rekindle their relationship, but Startsev is uninterested. As time passes, Startsev becomes indifferent to the world around him, while the Turkin family remains unchanged. The story was well-received, with critic D.N. Ovsyaniko-Kulikovsky praising Chekhov's unique storytelling method and considering "Ionych" as the most perfect example of Chekhov's art.
</p>



<h4>The Man in the Case</h4><p>"The Man in the Case" is a short story by Anton Chekhov, written in 1898. It is the first part of what is later referred to as The Little Trilogy. The story was written in Nice, France and first published in Russkaya Mysl magazine. The main character, Belikov, is based on A.F. Dyakonov, the inspector of the Taganrog City Gymnasium, which Chekhov graduated from. The story is narrated by Burkin, a gymnasium teacher, and tells the story of his colleague Belikov, a paranoid Greek teacher who insists on strict adherence to regulations. Belikov's life changes when a new teacher, Mikhail Kovalenko, and his lively sister Varenka join the school. Belikov is fascinated by Varenka, but his fear of complications and a caricature of him with Varenka throws him off balance. After a confrontation with Kovalenko, Belikov falls ill and dies. The story received mixed reviews, with some critics praising Chekhov's social commentary and others criticizing his perceived indifference to his characters.</p>



<h4>The House with the Mezzanine</h4><p>"The House with the Mezzanine" is a short story by Anton Chekhov, first published in 1896. The story revolves around a landscape painter who falls in love with Zhenya, the younger sister of Lydia Volchaninova, a stern and opinionated teacher dedicated to helping peasants. Lydia and the painter often clash over issues concerning the rural community and Russia as a whole. The painter and Zhenya share a deep connection, but their love is cut short when Lydia insists on their separation. The painter is left heartbroken and unable to forget Zhenya. The story was met with mixed reviews upon its release, with some critics accusing Chekhov of sympathizing with the painter's social apathy. The story's setting is believed to be based on the village of Bogimovo, where Chekhov spent the summer of 1891. The characters of the landlord Belokurov and his partner Lyubov Ivanovna are thought to be based on real-life individuals E.D. Bylim-Kolosovsky and his wife Anemaisa. The house with a mezzanine is speculated to be based on the Gorka estate in the Tver Governorate, which Chekhov visited in 1895.
</p>



<h4>The Student (Short Story)</h4><p>"The Student" is a short story by Anton Chekhov, first published in 1894. The story follows a clerical student, Ivan Velikopolsky, who on a cold Good Friday evening, encounters two widows, Vasilisa and Lukerya, by a fire. He recounts to them the biblical story of the Denial of Peter, which deeply moves the women. This leads Ivan to conclude that all of history is connected through truth and beauty. The story, which Chekhov wrote while on vacation in Yalta, was one of his shortest and his personal favorite. Critics have debated whether the protagonist's perspective at the end of the story aligns with Chekhov's own. The story has been praised for its compactness and delicacy. Some critics believe that Ivan's epiphany at the end of the story represents a "conversion" for the agnostic author himself. Others argue that Ivan's revelation was speculative and naive. The story's structure follows a descent-ascent pattern, mirroring Dante Alighieri's Inferno. The story's theme is catharsis and it explores the interdependence of all things.</p>



<h4>Kashtanka</h4><p>"Kashtanka" is a short story by Anton Chekhov, first published in 1887. The story was initially titled "In Learned Society" and was later revised by Chekhov into seven chapters and republished under the new title. The story was included in Volume 4 of Chekhov's Collected Works and has been reissued multiple times, including an illustrated version in 1903. The story revolves around a young mongrel named Kashtanka who gets lost and is taken in by a stranger. She befriends other animals in the house and learns to perform tricks. Despite her new comfortable life, she misses her old life with her original owner, a carpenter, and his son. When she hears her old family's voices during a performance, she rushes off stage to reunite with them, returning to her old life of hardship. The story was well-received, although some reviewers expressed dissatisfaction with the ending.</p>



<h4>The Lady with the Dog</h4><p>"The Lady with the Dog" is a short story by Anton Chekhov, first published in 1899. It tells the story of an adulterous affair between Dmitri Gurov, an unhappily married Moscow banker, and Anna Sergeyevna, a young married woman. Both meet while vacationing alone in Yalta. Despite expecting to forget Anna after their affair ends, Gurov finds himself deeply in love with her. He travels to her hometown under the pretense of personal business, but fails to meet her. Later, he encounters her at a theater and they confess their love for each other. The story ends without a resolution, leaving the characters in a state of uncertainty about their future together. The story has been interpreted in various ways, including as a commentary on the transformative power of love. The plot bears similarities to Chekhov's own life, as he fell in love with a younger woman while living in Yalta. The story has been widely translated and adapted for stage and screen, and is considered one of Chekhov's best-known works.

Another interesting and novel application is the computation of the sentiment score in a review. Here we are using the reviews on Amazon's websize for the [Fall of Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Giants), one of [Ken Follett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Follett)'s latest books. Amazon's reviews have a text and a score, defined as number of stars from 1 to 5, and we try to recover the score from the text. 
In the prompt it is important to specify the definition of the score, in our case only integer numbers from 1 to 5. The text of each review has been copied; `review_1` was given one star from the reviewer, `review_2` two stars, and so on.

Writing a novel with the advantage of knowing how wrong they were then, doesn't portrait the era...What a waste of time and money this was for me, and ashamed after the brilliant job Pillars of the earth was.

I really enjoyed every book so far of Ken Follett's "Pillars of the Earth"/"Kingsbridge" series. So I was a little disappointed with how this book turned out.

I read another review here that compared the book to "a textbook with some characters thrown in," and that's actually a pretty good description of how it reads as a novel. If I were picking a book to introduce people to the events of WWI who had never heard about it before, this would probably be a good pick. But the characters all seem a little thinly developed; every major character seems to coincidentally--and improbably--just happen to run into A) each other, and/or B) some famous historical figure.

There's a lot of detail, but not much of it fleshes out the characters very much. Most of the narration and dialogue is taken up with arguments and/or historical factoids about the period. There are some things that happen in the character's lives (every named female character ends up pregnant, which...I mean...ok, I guess) but mostly it kind of serves as window dressing: "But don't the Bolsheviks support the working class?" "Yes, but they've also started arresting people." "How horrible! Oh, I hope our newborn son will be raised in a world where the gulags aren't invented..." And so on.

I'm a pretty voracious reader. I'll read about anything. I love character development, world building, plot developments. It is great to read a book, fall in love with the characters, root them on through their difficulties and feel like you were there alongside them.

This book is quite good. The world building is on the scale of epic. Of course, the world is familiar. It is our own world at the beginning of WWI. Being American, I will say that I didn't know as much about this war as I thought I did. Loads of good, historical information is fed to you through this book. Through the character's lives. You want to tell them that it will eventually end and everything will be okay. But for some of them, it might not be. WWI is a period of great change for everyone. Those at war and those at home. The book begins before WWI and ends shortly after. You definitely get a sense of how everyone's lives changed through this period. You get a sense of how the world at large changes and how the next war will be set up.

The issue I have with this book is character development. The characters don't seem to be full-fledged people. They feel stilted and wooden. It isn't often that the reader gets to see inside the characters head to see their motives and see what they are feeling. This happening to the characters feel like they are just following a script, not acting as living, breathing people might. A few characters feel more fleshed out than others, but they are few and far between. With so many characters filling this world, I wish I could feel their motivations a little easier. Dialogue feels stilted and forced. Overly formal, like letters written rather than actual spoken words. That is, when there was dialogue. A lot of the dialogue was glossed over and summarized by the character after interactions were finished.

So, The book is quite good. Especially from a historical aspect. Just don't expect the characters to live and breathe for you throughout the reading. I look forward to reading the rest of the series.

"Fall of Giants" can have all the typical descriptors attached to it - epic, gripping, and massive are just a few that come to mind. This is the first in the promised "Century Trilogy" by Ken Follett and based upon my experience with the novel, I will be reading the next two when they come out. Weighing in at a hefty 985 pages, this is a book that is an "event" for the reader not just a pleasant way to past a few hours.

Spanning the time period leading up to World War I, the war itself, and just a bit of the time after that, this is a history lesson as well as a good read. I selected this for my book group to read for this month and there was more than one comment (including from me) about how lacking our understanding of that period in history was and how much we enjoyed the lessons given. While fiction, Ken Follett is known for massive amounts of research and a commitment to staying true to the period. The reader is privy to the historical events as they are viewed from multiple characters/families spanning the globe. Russian nobility and peasants, German aristocracy, American industrialists are just a few of the people we see moving through these pages and how their backgrounds influence their view of the unfolding hostilities. Another theme running throughout is the rise of the suffragette movement in Britain and why people were motivated to support it (or not).

I absolutely adored "Pillars of the Earth" but haven't read any of Ken Follett's more recent efforts until now. I really liked this book, but didn't fall in love with it the way I did Pillars. Even though it is a huge book, there were times when I felt character development was overshadowed by historical information and I struggled a bit with why some of the characters behaved the way they did. I also had a bit of a hard time swallowing how some characters managed to be in the exact right position at the exact right time to more the story along. Even though I thought there was room for improvement, it was well worth the time investment required to read this novel.

Bottom line: I will be recommending this to friends who enjoy historical fiction and am awaiting the next publication so I can dive back into Ken Follett's world.

Only the 5-star review was not correctly identified as such. Shorter texts was difficult to idenfity as well, possibly because each reviewer may have a different definition of what the stars mean. Overall, though, the results are quite good.

Spell-checking is widespread, while correcting the form is more involved and, perhaps, much more useful. With ChatGPT it is easy to ask for improvements or to reformulate a text in a different style. In the example below take the official Amazon's description of the book used above and ask for possible improvements. (Expectedly, there aren't many.)


```python
text = """
Fall of Giants is Ken Follett's magnificent new historical epic. The first novel in The Century Trilogy, it follows the fates of five interrelated families—American, German, Russian, English, and Welsh—as they move through the world-shaking dramas of the First World War, the Russian Revolution, and the struggle for women's suffrage.

Thirteen-year-old Billy Williams enters a man's world in the Welsh mining pits…. Gus Dewar, an American law student rejected in love, finds a surprising new career in Woodrow Wilson's White House…. Two orphaned Russian brothers, Grigori and Lev Peshkov, embark on radically different paths half a world apart when their plan to emigrate to America falls afoul of war, conscription, and revolution…. Billy's sister, Ethel, a housekeeper for the aristocratic Fitzherberts, takes a fateful step above her station, while Lady Maud Fitzherbert herself crosses deep into forbidden territory when she falls in love with Walter von Ulrich, a spy at the German embassy in London….

These characters and many others find their lives inextricably entangled as, in a saga of unfolding drama and intriguing complexity, Fall of Giants moves seamlessly from Washington to St. Petersburg, from the dirt and danger of a coal mine to the glittering chandeliers of a palace, from the corridors of power to the bedrooms of the mighty. As always with Ken Follett, the historical background is brilliantly researched and rendered, the action fast-moving, the characters rich in nuance and emotion. It is destined to be a new classic.

In future volumes of The Century Trilogy, subsequent generations of the same families will travel through the great events of the rest of the 20th century, changing themselves—and the century itself. With passion and the hand of a master, Follett brings us into a world we thought we knew, but now will never seem the same again.

We can go a step further -- not only correct, but also ask for an explanation of the corrections. We do this in text in Italian. The errors are quite simple


```python
prompt = f"""
Correggi il testo seguente e spiega le correzioni. Utilizza
il format Markdown.

<font color='#880E4F'>

Correzioni:

- "Un'altro passante ha buttato una sigaretta." dovrebbe essere "Un altro passante ha buttato una sigaretta." 
- "Se ci sarebbe qualcosa di bello in televisione, lo guarderei." dovrebbe essere "Se ci fosse qualcosa di bello in televisione, lo guarderei."

Spiegazioni:

- "Un'altro" è un errore comune in italiano. L'articolo indeterminativo "un'" si usa solo davanti a parole che iniziano con una vocale. Quindi, dovrebbe essere "un altro", non "un'altro".
- "Se ci sarebbe" è un errore di congiuntivo. In italiano, dopo "se" (quando introduce una proposizione ipotetica) si usa il congiuntivo. Quindi, dovrebbe essere "se ci fosse", non "se ci sarebbe".

# The History of the United States: 1609-1980s

## 17th Century: Colonization and Settlement

The history of the United States begins with the arrival of English settlers in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. However, it was not until 1609 that the first permanent English settlement was established. The early 17th century was marked by the struggle for survival, as settlers faced harsh conditions, disease, and conflicts with Native Americans. The establishment of the House of Burgesses in Virginia in 1619 marked the beginning of representative government in America.

The 17th century also saw the establishment of other colonies, including the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630, which became a major center for religious freedom for Puritans fleeing England. The century ended with the infamous Salem Witch Trials in 1692, a stark reminder of the dangers of mass hysteria and religious extremism.

## 18th Century: Revolution and Independence

The 18th century was a period of significant growth and change for the American colonies. The population grew rapidly, and the economy expanded as trade with England and other countries increased. However, tensions with England also grew, particularly over issues of taxation and representation.

These tensions culminated in the American Revolution, which began with the Battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775. The Declaration of Independence, drafted by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Continental Congress in 1776, marked the official break from England. The Revolutionary War ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which recognized the United States as an independent nation.

The late 18th century also saw the drafting of the U.S. Constitution, which established the framework for the federal government. The Constitution was ratified in 1788, and George Washington was inaugurated as the first President of the United States in 1789.

## 19th Century: Expansion, Civil War, and Industrialization

The 19th century was a period of rapid expansion for the United States. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 doubled the size of the country, and the concept of Manifest Destiny fueled further westward expansion. However, this expansion also led to conflicts with Native Americans and tensions over the expansion of slavery.

These tensions erupted into the Civil War in 1861, a brutal conflict that lasted four years and resulted in the deaths of over 600,000 Americans. The war ended with the Union's victory in 1865, and the subsequent Reconstruction period attempted to rebuild the South and integrate freed slaves into society.

The late 19th century was marked by the Industrial Revolution, which transformed the U.S. economy and society. The growth of factories and cities led to significant changes in work and daily life, and the rise of big business led to increasing economic inequality.

## 20th Century: World Wars, Depression, and Social Change

The 20th century was a period of significant change and upheaval for the United States. The country emerged as a world power after its involvement in World War I, and the Roaring Twenties was a period of economic prosperity and cultural innovation.

However, the Great Depression of the 1930s brought severe economic hardship. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs attempted to provide relief and recovery, but it was not until World War II that the economy fully recovered.

The post-war period was marked by the Cold War with the Soviet Union, a period of political tension and competition that lasted until the end of the 1980s. The Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s brought significant social change, as African Americans and other groups fought for equal rights.

The 1970s and 1980s were marked by economic challenges, including inflation and recession, as well as significant cultural and political changes. The Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal led to widespread disillusionment and cynicism towards government, while the rise of the conservative movement led to the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.

In conclusion, the history of the United States from 1609 to the 1980s is a story of growth, conflict, and change. From the early struggles of the English settlers to the social and political upheavals of the 20th century, this history reflects the diverse experiences and challenges that have shaped the United States as a nation.
