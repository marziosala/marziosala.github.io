The most straightforward application for ChatGPT is to use it as a sophisticated search engine, with the additional capability of getting the results in a specified format. Here we ask for the most populated cities in the world and the favorite sports.


```python
prompt = """

For "bad" questions (that is, the product does not exist), we generally get a warning that the question
is probably wrong, however for less-known companies and products we can get an answer that looks correct but is in reality completely wrong. In our example, while [supersonic toothbrushes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasonic_toothbrush) exist, there is no company named "The Great Goat Company" (several company names relate to "goat" however). A slightly simpler prompt would result in a more polished answer saying that such company cannot be found.

    <title>Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem</h1>

    <p>Today, we are going to prove the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.</p>

    <h2>Proof:</h2>

    <p>Consider a right-angled triangle with sides of lengths 'a', 'b', and 'c', where 'c' is the hypotenuse.</p>

    <p>Let's draw a square on each side of the triangle:</p>

    <img src="triangle.png" alt="Right-angled triangle with squares on each side">

    <p>The area of the square on side 'a' is 'a<sup>2</sup>', the area of the square on side 'b' is 'b<sup>2</sup>', and the area of the square on side 'c' is 'c<sup>2</sup>'.</p>

    <p>Now, let's rearrange these squares to form a larger square:</p>

    <img src="larger_square.png" alt="Larger square formed by rearranging the smaller squares">

    <p>The area of the larger square is equal to the sum of the areas of the smaller squares:</p>

    <p>'a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>'</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the area of the larger square can also be calculated by adding the areas of the two smaller squares:</p>

    <p>'(a + b)<sup>2</sup>'</p>

    <p>Expanding '(a + b)<sup>2</sup>', we get:</p>

    <p>'a<sup>2</sup> + 2ab + b<sup>2</sup>'</p>

    <p>Since the area of the larger square is the same, we can equate the two expressions:</p>

    <p>'a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + 2ab + b<sup>2</sup>'</p>

    <p>By canceling out 'a<sup>2</sup>' and 'b<sup>2</sup>' from both sides, we get:</p>

    <p>'c<sup>2</sup> = 2ab'</p>

    <p>Dividing both sides by '2', we obtain:</p>

    <p>'c<sup>2</sup>/2 = ab'</p>

    <p>Finally, dividing both sides by 'b', we get:</p>

    <p>'c<sup>2</sup>/2b = a'</p>

    <p>Therefore, we have proved that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.</p>

What we have done so far is still quite classical -- we could just search using a classical search engine and reformat the results ourselves, or search for a page with the proof of the Pytagorean's theorem. A novel that is instead to summarize a text: given some content, we want a shorter version of it, possibly specified the number of words to be used. We test it here on a few Wikipedia articles on the short stories of [Anton Chekhov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Chekhov), which are also short pages and as such works well. There is a limit to the number of tokens for ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatPGT 4, so in general for longer pages we would need to ask ChatGPT to summarize each section, which in turns requires us to clearly identify the sessions. As our scope is not the scraping of Wikipedia text, we use the shorter pages of some of the most famous Chekhov's novels. The helper function `print_summary` takes in input the page name, downloads it using the nice `wikipedia` package, and uses a simple prompt to get a summary. The output is tested on seven pages and can be easily extended to many more.


```python
def print_summary(page):
    story = wikipedia.page(page)
    prompt = f"""summarize the following text in about 200 words:

    {story.content}
    """

    response = get_completion(prompt)
    display(HTML(colorize(f"<h4>{page.replace('_', ' ')}</h4><p>{response}</p>")))

<font color='#880E4F'><h4>The Bishop (short story)</h4><p>"The Bishop" is a short story written by Anton Chekhov in 1902. It was published in the April 1902 issue of Zhurnal Dlya Vsekh and is considered to be partly autobiographical, reflecting Chekhov's own psychological state at the time. The story follows the last days of a terminally ill priest named Pyotr, who is experiencing premonitions of his own death. 

Chekhov had promised to write a story for Zhurnal Dlya Vsekh in a letter to Viktor Mirolyubov in December 1899. However, he didn't start working on it until much later. The story was sent to the magazine in February 1902, with severe censorial cuts and proofreader's errors. It was finally published in April 1902. 

The plot of the story revolves around Pyotr, who feels weak and unwell. He sees a woman in the crowd during a service who resembles his mother, whom he hasn't seen in nine years. This brings him great joy, but he also feels a strange unease. As his condition worsens, he becomes increasingly annoyed with the people around him and longs to be abroad. Pyotr eventually dies from typhoid, and a new bishop arrives in town, causing everyone to forget about him. 

The story received positive reviews in the contemporary Russian press, with critics praising its artistic merits and insightful portrayal of a Russian clergyman's life. Ivan Bunin described it as "written wonderfully." 

Overall, "The Bishop" is a poignant and introspective story that delves into themes of mortality, loneliness, and the search for meaning in life.</p></font>



<font color='#880E4F'><h4>Ionych</h4><p>"Ionych" is a short story written by Anton Chekhov in 1898. It was published in the September 1898 issue of the Monthly Literary Supplements to Niva magazine. The story was later included in Volume 9 of the Collected Works by A.P. Chekhov. 

The plot revolves around Doctor Dmitry Ionovich Startsev, who comes to the provincial town of S. to work for the local zemstvo. He becomes acquainted with the Turkin family, who are considered the pride of the town. Startsev is charmed by their daughter Ekaterina, known as Kotik, and falls in love with her. However, she rejects his proposal and leaves to enroll in the conservatory. Startsev eventually forgets about her and moves on with his life.

Four years later, Ekaterina returns to the town, but Startsev is no longer interested in her. He finds her attempts to rekindle their relationship irritating and avoids visiting the Turkin family. Years pass, and Startsev becomes a wealthy and respected doctor. He is referred to as "Ionych" by people, which implies a mixture of familiarity and slight contempt. The Turkin family remains the same, with the husband running a theater and Ekaterina playing the piano.

The story was well-received, with one critic praising Chekhov's unique writing style and psychological analysis. "Ionych" is considered a perfect example of Chekhov's art.</p></font>



<font color='#880E4F'><h4>The Man in the Case</h4><p>"The Man in the Case" is a short story written by Anton Chekhov in 1898. It is the first part of a trilogy that also includes "Gooseberries" and "About Love." The story was published in July 1898 in Russkaya Mysl magazine and later included in Chekhov's collected works.

The main character of the story is Belikov, a teacher of Greek who suffers from paranoia. He is obsessed with following rules and regulations and is suspicious of everything. Belikov terrorizes his school and the town with his demands and protests against disorder. When a new teacher named Mikhail Kovalenko arrives with his sister Varenka, the ladies at the school decide that Belikov should marry her. Belikov is fascinated by Varenka but is also fearful of complications.

Things take a turn for the worse when a caricature of Belikov and Varenka is drawn, and Belikov is horrified. He confronts Kovalenko about his behavior, but Kovalenko insults him and sends him rolling down the stairs. Belikov becomes ill and dies a month later.

The story received mixed reviews at the time of its publication. Some critics saw it as a realistic portrayal of a social type, while others criticized Chekhov's perceived indifference to his characters. However, it was praised for its social commentary and compared to the works of Gogol and Goncharov.

Overall, "The Man in the Case" explores themes of paranoia, conformity, and the oppressive nature of life in Russia at the time.</p></font>



<font color='#880E4F'><h4>The House with the Mezzanine</h4><p>"The House with the Mezzanine" is a short story written by Anton Chekhov in 1896. It was first published in the April 1896 issue of Russkaya Mysl and later included in Volume 9 of Chekhov's Collected Works. The story was translated into several languages during Chekhov's lifetime.

The background of the story is unclear, but Chekhov mentioned in a letter that he was writing a small story called "My Bride." The story was completed in early March, and it is believed to be based on Chekhov's experiences in the village of Bogimovo in Kaluga Governorate.

The plot revolves around Lydia Volchaninova, a stern and opinionated teacher, and a landscape painter who frequently visits her house. The painter falls in love with Lydia's younger sister, Zhenya, and they confess their love for each other. However, Zhenya's mother and sister insist that she end the relationship, and they leave the following day. The painter is left heartbroken, and he cannot forget Zhenya.

The story explores themes of love, social responsibility, and the clash between practical work and artistic pursuits. It received mixed reviews upon its publication, with some critics praising its poetic charm and others criticizing the author's supposed sympathy for the artist's social apathy.

Overall, "The House with the Mezzanine" is considered a classic Chekhov story, showcasing his ability to delve into complex human emotions and societal issues.</p></font>



<font color='#880E4F'><h4>The Student (Short Story)</h4><p>"The Student" is a short story by Anton Chekhov published in 1894. It follows Ivan Velikopolsky, a clerical student, as he walks home on a cold Good Friday evening. He meets two widows, Vasilisa and Lukerya, and tells them the story of the Denial of Peter from the canonical Gospels. The women are deeply moved by the story, leading Ivan to believe that truth and beauty connect all of history. The story is praised for its compactness and delicacy.

Critics have debated whether Ivan's perspective at the end of the story reflects Chekhov's own views. Some believe that Ivan's epiphany represents a conversion for the agnostic author, while others argue that it may be a transitory result of his youthful impetuosity. The structure of the story mirrors Dante's Inferno, with Ivan's journey from despondency to euphoria. The language used in the story changes from harsh and laconic to rich and gentle, reflecting the protagonist's emotional state.

Themes in "The Student" include catharsis, the interdependence of all things, and the power of narrative to evoke spiritual truth. The story has been praised for its economy, beauty, and power. It bridges the gap between Chekhov's earlier ecclesiastical and steppe stories and the lyricism of his later prose. It is considered a masterpiece of Chekhov's art and continues to resonate with readers, providing a sense of epiphany and forging connections in a secular world.</p></font>



<font color='#880E4F'><h4>Kashtanka</h4><p>"Kashtanka" is a short story written by Anton Chekhov in 1887. It was first published in December of that year and later released as a separate edition in 1892. The story follows the adventures of Kashtanka, a young dog who gets lost after being frightened by a military band. She is taken in by a kind stranger who treats her well and gives her the name Tyotka. Tyotka befriends her new neighbors, a gander named Ivan Ivanovich and an old tom-cat named Fyodor Timofeyitch. Together, they perform tricks and entertain their master. However, tragedy strikes when Ivan Ivanovich dies, leaving Tyotka and Fyodor Timofeyitch distraught. Eventually, Tyotka is given the opportunity to perform in a show, but when she hears her old family in the audience, she leaves the stage to be reunited with them. The story received positive reviews, although some critics were dissatisfied with the ending. Overall, "Kashtanka" is a heartwarming tale about loyalty, friendship, and the longing for home.</p></font>



<font color='#880E4F'><h4>The Lady with the Dog</h4><p>"The Lady with the Dog" is a short story written by Anton Chekhov in 1899. It tells the story of Dmitri Gurov, a married Moscow banker who is unhappy in his marriage and frequently has affairs. While on vacation in Yalta, he meets Anna Sergeyevna, a young married woman who is also unhappy in her marriage. They begin an affair and spend a lot of time together, but eventually, Anna's husband calls her back home. They part ways, thinking they will never see each other again.

However, Gurov cannot forget Anna and falls deeply in love with her. He travels to her hometown to find her, but realizes it would be unwise to intrude. He then sees Anna and her husband at a theater performance and confronts her. She confesses that she has been thinking of him constantly and begs him to leave. They make plans to see each other in Moscow.

The story explores themes of love, adultery, and the complexities of human relationships. It is considered one of Chekhov's greatest short stories and has been adapted into various forms, including ballet, film, stage plays, and even a musical-comedy version. The story is also referenced in other works, such as the film "The Reader" and the movie "Gurov and Anna."</p></font>


Another interesting and novel application is the computation of the sentiment score in a review. Here we are using the reviews on Amazon's websize for the [Fall of Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Giants), one of [Ken Follett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Follett)'s latest books. Amazon's reviews have a text and a score, defined as number of stars from 1 to 5, and we try to recover the score from the text. 
In the prompt it is important to specify the definition of the score, in our case only integer numbers from 1 to 5. The text of each review has been copied; `review_1` was given one star from the reviewer, `review_2` two stars, and so on.


```python

This is pure fiction...I understand that. If you ever wondered what it would be like to go back to 1914-1918 - knowing what we know today...then this book is for you. If you want any kind of probable idea of what the life and times of people were in that era - you won't get it here. A welsh servant wouldn't likely become a newspaper editor in those times...but here we have nothing but strong willed women doing what they want. The tragedy of this era was that they weren't allowed to...the ones we know about were so rare we actually remember them. As violent and horrible as living under the tzars of Russia were it was only equaled by the bloody violent Bolshiveks...ask anyone who lived thru it....likewise with the corrupt and violent unions. So history, even in a novel has been violated and reframed by the mighty left ! I guess that's how one gets published today...but don't confuse any of this with the real history of the era - It represents half the story and well seasoned with today's PC crap. Complete with wealthy educated white men who are all just so stupid and ego maniacs. We cam laugh today at the lunacy of the attitudes of Empire but if we want to truly understand what the people were like we need to remember,unlike This book, That they felt they were doing morally good as wrong as they may have been...they felt it as strong as we do about global environment efforts today...they truly believed they were helping the world. Writing a novel with the advantage of knowing how wrong they were then, doesn't portrait the era...What a waste of time and money this was for me, and ashamed after the brilliant job Pillars of the earth was. This is like reading old Russian history books from the soviet era...Lenin would grant this book a peoples award Im sure

I really enjoyed every book so far of Ken Follett's "Pillars of the Earth"/"Kingsbridge" series. So I was a little disappointed with how this book turned out.

I read another review here that compared the book to "a textbook with some characters thrown in," and that's actually a pretty good description of how it reads as a novel. If I were picking a book to introduce people to the events of WWI who had never heard about it before, this would probably be a good pick. But the characters all seem a little thinly developed; every major character seems to coincidentally--and improbably--just happen to run into A) each other, and/or B) some famous historical figure.

There's a lot of detail, but not much of it fleshes out the characters very much. Most of the narration and dialogue is taken up with arguments and/or historical factoids about the period. There are some things that happen in the character's lives (every named female character ends up pregnant, which...I mean...ok, I guess) but mostly it kind of serves as window dressing: "But don't the Bolsheviks support the working class?" "Yes, but they've also started arresting people." "How horrible! Oh, I hope our newborn son will be raised in a world where the gulags aren't invented..." And so on.

I'm a pretty voracious reader. I'll read about anything. I love character development, world building, plot developments. It is great to read a book, fall in love with the characters, root them on through their difficulties and feel like you were there alongside them.

This book is quite good. The world building is on the scale of epic. Of course, the world is familiar. It is our own world at the beginning of WWI. Being American, I will say that I didn't know as much about this war as I thought I did. Loads of good, historical information is fed to you through this book. Through the character's lives. You want to tell them that it will eventually end and everything will be okay. But for some of them, it might not be. WWI is a period of great change for everyone. Those at war and those at home. The book begins before WWI and ends shortly after. You definitely get a sense of how everyone's lives changed through this period. You get a sense of how the world at large changes and how the next war will be set up.

The issue I have with this book is character development. The characters don't seem to be full-fledged people. They feel stilted and wooden. It isn't often that the reader gets to see inside the characters head to see their motives and see what they are feeling. This happening to the characters feel like they are just following a script, not acting as living, breathing people might. A few characters feel more fleshed out than others, but they are few and far between. With so many characters filling this world, I wish I could feel their motivations a little easier. Dialogue feels stilted and forced. Overly formal, like letters written rather than actual spoken words. That is, when there was dialogue. A lot of the dialogue was glossed over and summarized by the character after interactions were finished.

So, The book is quite good. Especially from a historical aspect. Just don't expect the characters to live and breathe for you throughout the reading. I look forward to reading the rest of the series.

"Fall of Giants" can have all the typical descriptors attached to it - epic, gripping, and massive are just a few that come to mind. This is the first in the promised "Century Trilogy" by Ken Follett and based upon my experience with the novel, I will be reading the next two when they come out. Weighing in at a hefty 985 pages, this is a book that is an "event" for the reader not just a pleasant way to past a few hours.

Spanning the time period leading up to World War I, the war itself, and just a bit of the time after that, this is a history lesson as well as a good read. I selected this for my book group to read for this month and there was more than one comment (including from me) about how lacking our understanding of that period in history was and how much we enjoyed the lessons given. While fiction, Ken Follett is known for massive amounts of research and a commitment to staying true to the period. The reader is privy to the historical events as they are viewed from multiple characters/families spanning the globe. Russian nobility and peasants, German aristocracy, American industrialists are just a few of the people we see moving through these pages and how their backgrounds influence their view of the unfolding hostilities. Another theme running throughout is the rise of the suffragette movement in Britain and why people were motivated to support it (or not).

I absolutely adored "Pillars of the Earth" but haven't read any of Ken Follett's more recent efforts until now. I really liked this book, but didn't fall in love with it the way I did Pillars. Even though it is a huge book, there were times when I felt character development was overshadowed by historical information and I struggled a bit with why some of the characters behaved the way they did. I also had a bit of a hard time swallowing how some characters managed to be in the exact right position at the exact right time to more the story along. Even though I thought there was room for improvement, it was well worth the time investment required to read this novel.

Bottom line: I will be recommending this to friends who enjoy historical fiction and am awaiting the next publication so I can dive back into Ken Follett's world.

I normally donât like books because the author doesnât keep my interest.

Only the 5-star review was not correctly identified as such. Shorter texts was difficult to idenfity as well, possibly because each reviewer may have a different definition of what the stars mean. Overall, though, the results are quite good.

Spell-checking is widespread, while correcting the form is more involved and, perhaps, much more useful. With ChatGPT it is easy to ask for improvements or to reformulate a text in a different style. In the example below take the official Amazon's description of the book used above and ask for possible improvements. (Expectedly, there aren't many.)

Fall of Giants is Ken Follett's magnificent new historical epic. The first novel in The Century Trilogy, it follows the fates of five interrelated familiesâAmerican, German, Russian, English, and Welshâas they move through the world-shaking dramas of the First World War, the Russian Revolution, and the struggle for women's suffrage.

Thirteen-year-old Billy Williams enters a man's world in the Welsh mining pitsâ¦. Gus Dewar, an American law student rejected in love, finds a surprising new career in Woodrow Wilson's White Houseâ¦. Two orphaned Russian brothers, Grigori and Lev Peshkov, embark on radically different paths half a world apart when their plan to emigrate to America falls afoul of war, conscription, and revolutionâ¦. Billy's sister, Ethel, a housekeeper for the aristocratic Fitzherberts, takes a fateful step above her station, while Lady Maud Fitzherbert herself crosses deep into forbidden territory when she falls in love with Walter von Ulrich, a spy at the German embassy in Londonâ¦.

These characters and many others find their lives inextricably entangled as, in a saga of unfolding drama and intriguing complexity, Fall of Giants moves seamlessly from Washington to St. Petersburg, from the dirt and danger of a coal mine to the glittering chandeliers of a palace, from the corridors of power to the bedrooms of the mighty. As always with Ken Follett, the historical background is brilliantly researched and rendered, the action fast-moving, the characters rich in nuance and emotion. It is destined to be a new classic.

In future volumes of The Century Trilogy, subsequent generations of the same families will travel through the great events of the rest of the 20th century, changing themselvesâand the century itself. With passion and the hand of a master, Follett brings us into a world we thought we knew, but now will never seem the same again.

Spiegazioni:

- "Un'altro" Ã¨ un errore comune in italiano. L'articolo indeterminativo "un'" si usa solo davanti a parole che iniziano con una vocale. Quindi, dovrebbe essere "un altro", non "un'altro".
- "Se ci sarebbe" Ã¨ un errore di congiuntivo. In italiano, dopo "se" (quando introduce una proposizione ipotetica) si usa il congiuntivo. Quindi, dovrebbe essere "se ci fosse", non "se ci sarebbe".

# The History of the United States: 1609-1980s

## 17th Century: Colonization and Settlement

The history of the United States begins with the arrival of English settlers in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. However, it was not until 1609 that the first permanent English settlement was established. The early 17th century was marked by the struggle for survival, as settlers faced harsh conditions, disease, and conflicts with Native Americans. The establishment of the House of Burgesses in Virginia in 1619 marked the beginning of representative government in America.

The 17th century also saw the establishment of other colonies, including the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630, which became a major center for religious freedom for Puritans fleeing England. The century ended with the infamous Salem Witch Trials in 1692, a stark reminder of the dangers of mass hysteria and religious extremism.

## 18th Century: Revolution and Independence

The 18th century was a period of significant growth and change for the American colonies. The population grew rapidly, and the economy expanded as trade with England and other countries increased. However, tensions with England also grew, particularly over issues of taxation and representation.

These tensions culminated in the American Revolution, which began with the Battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775. The Declaration of Independence, drafted by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Continental Congress in 1776, marked the official break from England. The Revolutionary War ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which recognized the United States as an independent nation.

The late 18th century also saw the drafting of the U.S. Constitution, which established the framework for the federal government. The Constitution was ratified in 1788, and George Washington was inaugurated as the first President of the United States in 1789.

## 19th Century: Expansion, Civil War, and Industrialization

The 19th century was a period of rapid expansion for the United States. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 doubled the size of the country, and the concept of Manifest Destiny fueled further westward expansion. However, this expansion also led to conflicts with Native Americans and tensions over the expansion of slavery.

These tensions erupted into the Civil War in 1861, a brutal conflict that lasted four years and resulted in the deaths of over 600,000 Americans. The war ended with the Union's victory in 1865, and the subsequent Reconstruction period attempted to rebuild the South and integrate freed slaves into society.

The late 19th century was marked by the Industrial Revolution, which transformed the U.S. economy and society. The growth of factories and cities led to significant changes in work and daily life, and the rise of big business led to increasing economic inequality.

## 20th Century: World Wars, Depression, and Social Change

The 20th century was a period of significant change and upheaval for the United States. The country emerged as a world power after its involvement in World War I, and the Roaring Twenties was a period of economic prosperity and cultural innovation.

However, the Great Depression of the 1930s brought severe economic hardship. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs attempted to provide relief and recovery, but it was not until World War II that the economy fully recovered.

The post-war period was marked by the Cold War with the Soviet Union, a period of political tension and competition that lasted until the end of the 1980s. The Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s brought significant social change, as African Americans and other groups fought for equal rights.

The 1970s and 1980s were marked by economic challenges, including inflation and recession, as well as significant cultural and political changes. The Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal led to widespread disillusionment and cynicism towards government, while the rise of the conservative movement led to the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.

In conclusion, the history of the United States from 1609 to the 1980s is a story of growth, conflict, and change. From the early struggles of the English settlers to the social and political upheavals of the 20th century, this history reflects the diverse experiences and challenges that have shaped the United States as a nation.
