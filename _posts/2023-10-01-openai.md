A task for which ChatGPT excels is to summarize a text. We test is here on a few Wikipedia articles on the short stories of [Anton Chekhov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Chekhov), which are also short pages and as such works well. In fact, it is easy to reach the limit of tokens for ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatPGT 4, so in general for longer pages we would need to ask ChatGPT to summarize each section, which in turns requires us to clearly identify the sessions. As our scope is not the scraping of Wikipedia text, we use the shorter pages of some of the most famous Chekhov's novels. The helper function `print_summary` takes in input the page name, downloads it using the nice `wikipedia` package, and uses a simple prompt to get a summary. The output is tested on seven pages and can be easily extended to many more.

<h4>The Bishop (short story)</h4><p>"The Bishop" is a 1902 short story by Anton Chekhov, first published in the April 1902 issue of Zhurnal Dlya Vsekh. The story, which reflects the psychological state of the author, is considered to be partly autobiographical. It tells the tale of the last days of a terminally ill priest. The story was written after Chekhov promised Viktor Mirolyubov to write a story for Zhurnal Dlya Vsekh. The story was delayed due to Chekhov's deteriorating health and was finally published in April 1902. The plot revolves around Pyotr, the Bishop at the Staro-Petrovski Convent, who is terminally ill. He sees a woman who looks like his mother in the crowd during a service, and later learns that his mother had indeed come to visit him. As his condition worsens, he becomes increasingly annoyed with the people around him and longs to be abroad. He eventually dies a day before Easter Sunday. A month later, a new bishop arrives and everyone forgets about Pyotr. The story was well-received by the contemporary Russian press, with several critics praising its artistic merits and insightful depiction of a Russian clergyman's life.
</p>



<h4>Ionych</h4><p>"Ionych" is a short story written by Anton Chekhov in 1898. The story was first published in the September 1898 issue of the Monthly Literary Supplements to Niva magazine. The plot revolves around Doctor Dmitry Ionovich Startsev, who moves to a provincial town to work for the local zemstvo. He becomes acquainted with the Turkin family, who are considered the pride of the town. Startsev falls in love with the Turkin's daughter, Ekaterina, but she rejects his proposal to focus on her musical ambitions. Years later, Startsev is a respected and wealthy doctor, while Ekaterina has abandoned her musical dreams. She attempts to rekindle their relationship, but Startsev is uninterested. As time passes, Startsev becomes indifferent to the world around him, while the Turkin family remains unchanged. The story was well-received, with critic D.N. Ovsyaniko-Kulikovsky praising Chekhov's unique storytelling method and considering "Ionych" as the most perfect example of Chekhov's art.
</p>



<h4>The Man in the Case</h4><p>"The Man in the Case" is a short story by Anton Chekhov, written in 1898. It is the first part of what is later referred to as The Little Trilogy. The story was written in Nice, France and first published in Russkaya Mysl magazine. The main character, Belikov, is based on A.F. Dyakonov, the inspector of the Taganrog City Gymnasium, which Chekhov graduated from. The story is narrated by Burkin, a gymnasium teacher, and tells the story of his colleague Belikov, a paranoid Greek teacher who insists on strict adherence to regulations. Belikov's life changes when a new teacher, Mikhail Kovalenko, and his lively sister Varenka join the school. Belikov is fascinated by Varenka, but his fear of complications and a caricature of him with Varenka throws him off balance. After a confrontation with Kovalenko, Belikov falls ill and dies. The story received mixed reviews, with some critics praising Chekhov's social commentary and others criticizing his perceived indifference to his characters.</p>



<h4>The House with the Mezzanine</h4><p>"The House with the Mezzanine" is a short story by Anton Chekhov, first published in 1896. The story revolves around a landscape painter who falls in love with Zhenya, the younger sister of Lydia Volchaninova, a stern and opinionated teacher dedicated to helping peasants. Lydia and the painter often clash over issues concerning the rural community and Russia as a whole. The painter and Zhenya share a deep connection, but their love is cut short when Lydia insists on their separation. The painter is left heartbroken and unable to forget Zhenya. The story was met with mixed reviews upon its release, with some critics accusing Chekhov of sympathizing with the painter's social apathy. The story's setting is believed to be based on the village of Bogimovo, where Chekhov spent the summer of 1891. The characters of the landlord Belokurov and his partner Lyubov Ivanovna are thought to be based on real-life individuals E.D. Bylim-Kolosovsky and his wife Anemaisa. The house with a mezzanine is speculated to be based on the Gorka estate in the Tver Governorate, which Chekhov visited in 1895.
</p>



<h4>The Student (Short Story)</h4><p>"The Student" is a short story by Anton Chekhov, first published in 1894. The story follows a clerical student, Ivan Velikopolsky, who on a cold Good Friday evening, encounters two widows, Vasilisa and Lukerya, by a fire. He recounts to them the biblical story of the Denial of Peter, which deeply moves the women. This leads Ivan to conclude that all of history is connected through truth and beauty. The story, which Chekhov wrote while on vacation in Yalta, was one of his shortest and his personal favorite. Critics have debated whether the protagonist's perspective at the end of the story aligns with Chekhov's own. The story has been praised for its compactness and delicacy. Some critics believe that Ivan's epiphany at the end of the story represents a "conversion" for the agnostic author himself. Others argue that Ivan's revelation was speculative and naive. The story's structure follows a descent-ascent pattern, mirroring Dante Alighieri's Inferno. The story's theme is catharsis and it explores the interdependence of all things.</p>



<h4>Kashtanka</h4><p>"Kashtanka" is a short story by Anton Chekhov, first published in 1887. The story was initially titled "In Learned Society" and was later revised by Chekhov into seven chapters and republished under the new title. The story was included in Volume 4 of Chekhov's Collected Works and has been reissued multiple times, including an illustrated version in 1903. The story revolves around a young mongrel named Kashtanka who gets lost and is taken in by a stranger. She befriends other animals in the house and learns to perform tricks. Despite her new comfortable life, she misses her old life with her original owner, a carpenter, and his son. When she hears her old family's voices during a performance, she rushes off stage to reunite with them, returning to her old life of hardship. The story was well-received, although some reviewers expressed dissatisfaction with the ending.</p>



<h4>The Lady with the Dog</h4><p>"The Lady with the Dog" is a short story by Anton Chekhov, first published in 1899. It tells the story of an adulterous affair between Dmitri Gurov, an unhappily married Moscow banker, and Anna Sergeyevna, a young married woman. Both meet while vacationing alone in Yalta. Despite expecting to forget Anna after their affair ends, Gurov finds himself deeply in love with her. He travels to her hometown under the pretense of personal business, but fails to meet her. Later, he encounters her at a theater and they confess their love for each other. The story ends without a resolution, leaving the characters in a state of uncertainty about their future together. The story has been interpreted in various ways, including as a commentary on the transformative power of love. The plot bears similarities to Chekhov's own life, as he fell in love with a younger woman while living in Yalta. The story has been widely translated and adapted for stage and screen, and is considered one of Chekhov's best-known works.

    <h1>Pitagorean Theorem</h1>
    <p>The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry, discovered by the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras. It states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This can be written as:</p>
    <h2>a² + b² = c²</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Pythagorean.svg/1200px-Pythagorean.svg.png" alt="Pythagorean Theorem">
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>c represents the length of the hypotenuse,</li>
        <li>a and b represent the lengths of the other two sides.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Proof</h2>
    <p>There are many proofs for the Pythagorean theorem. Here is one of the simplest, using area:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Construct a square with side length (a+b), then draw in the square four triangles each with sides a, b, and c, and a smaller square with side length c.</li>
        <li>The total area of the large square is (a+b)² = a² + 2ab + b².</li>
        <li>The total area of the large square is also the sum of the areas of the four triangles and the smaller square, which is 4*(1/2)*a*b + c² = 2ab + c².</li>
        <li>Setting these two expressions for the area of the large square equal to each other gives a² + 2ab + b² = 2ab + c².</li>
        <li>Subtracting 2ab from both sides gives the Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c².</li>
    </ol>

Technology
The Internet enabled online chess as a new medium of playing, with chess servers allowing users to play other people from different parts of the world in real time. The first such server, known as Internet Chess Server or ICS, was developed at the University of Utah in 1992. ICS formed the basis for the first commercial chess server, the Internet Chess Club, which was launched in 1995, and for other early chess servers such as FICS (Free Internet Chess Server). Since then, many other platforms have appeared, and online chess began to rival over-the-board chess in popularity.[103][104] During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the isolation ensuing from quarantines imposed in many places around the world, combined with the success of the popular Netflix show The Queen's Gambit and other factors such as the popularity of online tournaments (notably PogChamps) and chess Twitch streamers, resulted in a surge of popularity not only for online chess, but for the game of chess in general; this phenomenon has been referred to in the media as the 2020 online chess boom.[105][106]

Computer chess has also seen major advances. By the 1990s, chess engines could consistently defeat most amateurs, and in 1997 Deep Blue defeated World Champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match, starting an era of computer dominance at the highest level of chess. In the 2010s, engines significantly stronger than even the best human players became accessible for free on a number of PC and mobile platforms, and free engine analysis became a commonplace feature on internet chess servers. An adverse effect of the easy availability of engine analysis on hand-held devices and personal computers has been the rise of computer cheating, which has grown to be a major concern in both over-the-board and online chess.[107] In 2017, AlphaZero – a neural network also capable of playing shogi and Go – was introduced. Since then, many chess engines based on neural network evaluation have been written, the best of which have surpassed the traditional "brute-force" engines. AlphaZero also introduced many novel ideas and ways of playing the game, which affected the style of play at the top level.[108]

As endgame tablebases developed, they began to provide perfect play in endgame positions in which the game-theoretical outcome was previously unknown, such as positions with king, queen and pawn against king and queen. In 1991, Lewis Stiller published a tablebase for select six-piece endgames,[109][110] and by 2005, following the publication of Nalimov tablebases, all six-piece endgame positions were solved. In 2012, Lomonosov tablebases were published which solved all seven-piece endgame positions.[111] Use of tablebases enhances the performance of chess engines by providing definitive results in some branches of analysis.

Technological progress made in the 1990s and the 21st century has influenced the way that chess is studied at all levels, as well as the state of chess as a spectator sport.

Previously, preparation at the professional level required an extensive chess library and several subscriptions to publications such as Chess Informant to keep up with opening developments and study opponents' games. Today, preparation at the professional level involves the use of databases containing millions of games, and engines to analyze different opening variations and prepare novelties.[112] A number of online learning resources are also available for players of all levels, such as online courses, tactics trainers, and video lessons.[113]

Since the late 1990s, it has been possible to follow major international chess events online, the players' moves being relayed in real time. Sensory boards have been developed to enable automatic transmission of moves. Chess players will frequently run engines while watching these games, allowing them to quickly identify mistakes by the players and spot tactical opportunities. While in the past the moves have been relayed live, today chess organizers will often impose a half-hour delay as an anti-cheating measure. In the mid-to-late 2010s – and especially following the 2020 online boom – it became commonplace for supergrandmasters, such as Hikaru Nakamura and Magnus Carlsen, to livestream chess content on platforms such as Twitch.[114][115] Also following the boom, online chess started being viewed as an e-sport, with e-sport teams signing chess players for the first time in 2020.[116]

Growth
Organized chess even for young children has become common. FIDE holds world championships for age levels down to 8 years old. The largest tournaments, in number of players, are those held for children.[117]

The number of grandmasters and other chess professionals has also grown in the modern era. Kenneth Regan and Guy Haworth conducted research involving comparison of move choices by players of different levels and from different periods with the analysis of strong chess engines; they concluded that the increase in the number of grandmasters and higher Elo ratings of the top players reflect an actual increase in the average standard of play, rather than "rating inflation" or "title inflation".[118]

Professional chess
In 1993, Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short broke ties with FIDE to organize their own match for the World Championship and formed a competing Professional Chess Association (PCA). From then until 2006, there were two simultaneous World Championships and respective World Champions: the PCA or "classical" champions extending the Steinitzian tradition in which the current champion plays a challenger in a series of games, and the other following FIDE's new format of many players competing in a large knockout tournament to determine the champion. Kasparov lost his PCA title in 2000 to Vladimir Kramnik of Russia.[119] Due to the complicated state of world chess politics and difficulties obtaining commercial sponsorships, Kasparov was never able to challenge for the title again. Despite this, he continued to dominate in top level tournaments and remained the world's highest rated player until his retirement from competitive chess in 2005.

The World Chess Championship 2006, in which Kramnik beat the FIDE World Champion Veselin Topalov, reunified the titles and made Kramnik the undisputed World Chess Champion.[120] In September 2007, he lost the title to Viswanathan Anand of India, who won the championship tournament in Mexico City. Anand defended his title in the revenge match of 2008,[121] 2010 and 2012. Magnus Carlsen defeated Anand in the 2013 World Chess Championship, and defended his title in 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2021. After the 2021 match, he announced that he would not defend his title a fifth time, so the 2023 World Chess Championship was played between the winner and runner-up of the Candidates Tournament 2022: respectively, Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia and Ding Liren of China. Ding beat Nepomniachtchi, making him the current World Chess Champion.

<tt>La fondazione dell'Italia è un evento storico di grande importanza che risale al 17 marzo 1861, quando il Regno di Sardegna, guidato da Vittorio Emanuele II di Savoia, venne proclamato Regno d'Italia. Questo segnò la fine di secoli di frammentazione politica e l'unificazione di diverse regioni e stati italiani sotto un'unica entità nazionale.

Il processo di unificazione italiana, noto come Risorgimento, iniziò nel XIX secolo e fu caratterizzato da una serie di movimenti politici, sociali e militari che miravano a creare uno stato unitario italiano. Tra i principali protagonisti di questo periodo vi furono personalità come Giuseppe Garibaldi, Camillo Benso di Cavour e Giuseppe Mazzini.

La fondazione dell'Italia fu il risultato di una serie di eventi e conflitti che portarono alla sconfitta dei vari regimi e stati preesistenti. Uno dei momenti chiave fu la guerra d'indipendenza italiana del 1859, che vide il Regno di Sardegna, con l'appoggio di Francia e Gran Bretagna, combattere contro l'Impero austriaco. Questa guerra portò alla creazione del Regno d'Italia, anche se alcune regioni come il Veneto e il Lazio rimasero sotto il controllo austriaco e papale rispettivamente.

La fondazione dell'Italia rappresentò un importante passo verso l'unità nazionale e l'affermazione dell'identità italiana. Tuttavia, il processo di unificazione non fu completo e molte sfide e divisioni rimasero ancora da affrontare. Ad esempio, il Sud Italia era caratterizzato da una situazione economica e sociale molto diversa rispetto al Nord, e ciò portò a tensioni e disparità che persistono ancora oggi.

Nonostante le difficoltà, la fondazione dell'Italia rappresentò un momento di grande orgoglio nazionale e segnò l'inizio di un nuovo capitolo nella storia del paese. Da allora, l'Italia ha affrontato numerosi cambiamenti politici, sociali ed economici, ma l'idea di un'Italia unita e indivisibile rimane un valore fondamentale per gli italiani.</tt>

Potresti provare a dirle in modo gentile e diplomatico che l'intelligenza non si misura solo attraverso le conoscenze o le capacità tecniche, ma anche attraverso l'umiltà e la capacità di ascolto. Potresti dirle che è importante essere aperti alle opinioni degli altri e considerare che ognuno ha qualcosa da insegnare, anche se non sembra così a prima vista. Potresti anche suggerirle di essere più umile e di non cercare sempre di dimostrare di essere la persona più intelligente in ogni situazione, perché questo potrebbe alienare le persone intorno a lei. Ricorda di essere gentile e rispettoso nel comunicare il tuo punto di vista.

Hello students! Today, we are going to learn about a very important theorem in mathematics called the Pythagorean theorem. This theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who discovered it over 2,500 years ago.

The Pythagorean theorem is all about right triangles. A right triangle is a triangle that has one angle that measures exactly 90 degrees, which we call a right angle. The theorem helps us find the length of one side of a right triangle when we know the lengths of the other two sides.

Now, let's start with a question. What do you think the Pythagorean theorem is about?



```python
messages.append({'role': 'assistant', 'content': response})
messages.append({'role': 'user', 'content': 'it is somethng about Mathematics, but it\'s difficult!'})
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages)
display(Markdown(response))
```


That's right! The Pythagorean theorem is a mathematical concept, but don't worry, it's not as difficult as it may seem at first. It's actually a very useful and practical theorem that we can apply to solve real-world problems.

To help you understand it better, let's break it down step by step. First, let's talk about the sides of a right triangle. The longest side of a right triangle is called the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are called the legs.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs. In other words, if we label the lengths of the legs as a and b, and the length of the hypotenuse as c, then the theorem can be written as:

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

Now, let's try a question to see if you understand. If one leg of a right triangle measures 3 units and the other leg measures 4 units, what is the length of the hypotenuse?



```python
messages.append({'role': 'assistant', 'content': response})
messages.append({'role': 'user', 'content': '6?'})
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages)
display(Markdown(response))
```


Great job! Let's use the Pythagorean theorem to confirm your answer.

According to the theorem, we have:

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

Substituting the given values, we have:

3^2 + 4^2 = c^2

9 + 16 = c^2

25 = c^2

To find the value of c, we need to take the square root of both sides:

√25 = √c^2

5 = c

So, the length of the hypotenuse is indeed 5 units.

Now, let's move on to the final proof of the Pythagorean theorem. This proof is a bit more advanced, but I believe you can follow along.



```python
messages.append({'role': 'assistant', 'content': response})
messages.append({'role': 'user', 'content': "uhm can we rather take a break?"})
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages)
display(Markdown(response))
```


Of course, we can take a short break before we continue. Take a few minutes to relax and stretch. When you're ready, we can continue with the final proof of the Pythagorean theorem.



```python
messages.append({'role': 'assistant', 'content': response})
messages.append({'role': 'user', 'content': "we are back, let's continue"})
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages)
display(Markdown(response))
```


Welcome back, everyone! Let's dive into the final proof of the Pythagorean theorem.

The proof we will discuss is called the geometric proof. It involves using squares to visually demonstrate the relationship between the sides of a right triangle.

Imagine we have a right triangle with legs of lengths a and b, and a hypotenuse of length c. We will construct squares on each side of the triangle, as shown below:

```
        a
   ___________
  |           |
  |           |
b |           | c
  |___________|
```

The area of the square on the leg of length a is a^2, and the area of the square on the leg of length b is b^2. The area of the square on the hypotenuse c is c^2.

Now, let's rearrange these squares to form a larger square:

```
        a
   ___________
  |           |
  |           |
  |           |
  |___________|_________
  |                   |
  |                   |
b |                   | c
  |                   |
  |                   |
  |___________________|
```

The area of this larger square is equal to the sum of the areas of the smaller squares. So, we have:

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

This geometric proof visually demonstrates the relationship between the sides of a right triangle, which is the essence of the Pythagorean theorem.

Now, let's try a problem to apply the Pythagorean theorem in a real-world scenario.

Problem: A ladder is leaning against a wall. The base of the ladder is 6 feet away from the wall, and the ladder reaches a height of 8 feet. How long is the ladder?

To solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. Let's label the base of the ladder as a, the height as b, and the length of the ladder as c.

According to the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

Substituting the given values, we have:

6^2 + 8^2 = c^2

36 + 64 = c^2

100 = c^2

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

√100 = √c^2

10 = c

Therefore, the length of the ladder is 10 feet.

That's it for today's lesson on the Pythagorean theorem! I hope you now have a better understanding of this important concept. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
