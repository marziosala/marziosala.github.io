excerpt: "Looking for similar articles using OpenAI's text embedding models"
---

In this article we look at [embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) with the aim of estimating the similarity between different texts. An embedding is a vector representation of a word or a text. The idea is to transform a set of words $T$ into a mathematical object $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, with $n$ large, say a thousand or more. Crucially, the value $n$ is the same for any $T$, irrespective of the number of words that compose it; this makes it possible to compare different texts using simple vector operations.

As concrete use case, we look at the articles published on [arxiv.org](https://www.arxiv.org); the embeddings are provided by [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com). Our goal is to detect articles that are similar to a given one.

The requires packages are the usual suspects; the only additions are the [openai](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) and the [arxiv](https://github.com/lukasschwab/arxiv.py) python packages, both easily installable with `pip`.


```python

import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
import openai
from openai.embeddings_utils import cosine_similarity, get_embedding
import pickle
import requests
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans, AgglomerativeClustering
```

Of the many models OpenAI has published, here we are interested in *text* models. There are several of them, some marked as `similarity` and others as `embedding`. The difference is that `similarity` models tend to be used for applications where two pieces of text are compared to get a similarity score as output, while `embedding` models generally take an input query and then return the top $K$ best matches from a collection of texts that was embedded into a database previously. Therefore, for what we are doing here we need `similarity`.


```python
models = openai.Model.list()
models = pd.DataFrame(models['data']).set_index('id')
models.created = pd.to_datetime(models.created, unit='s')
models[models.index.str.contains('text')].sort_values('created', ascending=False)[:10]
```

OpenAI [suggests](https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-embedding-model) to use `text-embedding-ada-002`, so this is what we will use. 
According to OpenAI, this new model unifies the specific models for text similarity, text search and code search into a single new model, and performs better than the previous embedding models across a diverse set of text search, sentence similarity, and code search benchmarks. The price at the time of writing is about 3,000 pages per dollar, which is quite cheap. An alternative would be `text-similarity-ada-001`, not displayed in the list above because released in April 2022.

Since our scope is to search for similar articles published on arxiv.org, we first need to download the salient features of the articles. We will limit ourselve to title and summary, although a deeper analysis would also focus on the article content (which needs extracing from the PDF or from the source files). The nice [arxiv](https://github.com/lukasschwab/arxiv.py) package provides an easy-to-use API for doing exactly that. The `query()` function below simply queries for the specified number of articles, sortd by update date, and returns a list with the provided metadata.


```python
def query(query, max_results, offset: int = 0):
    search = arxiv.Search(
        query=query,
        max_results=max_results,
        sort_by=arxiv.SortCriterion.LastUpdatedDate
    )
    client = arxiv.Client()
    return list(client.results(search=search, offset=offset))
```

As a first check, we query the last 50 articles in six [categories](https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy) that are quite different from each other: astrophysics, economics, condensed matter, quantitative biology and quantitative finance. In general an article on astrophysics should have little in common with one on quantitative finance or condensed matter. Overlaps may exists between economics and quantitative finance, and mathematics is used in all other sciences. To make things a bit more difficult, arxiv has a single main category as well as many secondary ones, and the query for a certain category returns articles that have that category as either the main or one of the secondary ones, so the distinction may not always be clear-cut. All considered, though, we should be able to cluster them quite nicely


```python
results = []
for cat in ['astro-ph', 'econ', 'cond-mat', 'math', 'q-bio', 'q-fin']:
    results += query(f'cat:{cat}.*', 50, offset=0)
```

We use title and summary to compute the embedding. It takes about a minute to call `get_embedding()` for the 300 articles of our tests; once computed, embeddings are stored in a dataframe together with the title. The embedding is defined as the title plus the summary.


```python
def get_text(result):
    return result.title + ' ' + result.summary.replace('\n', ' ')
```


```python
embeddings = []
for result in results:
    embeddings.append(get_embedding(get_text(result), "text-embedding-ada-002"))
```


```python
def assemble_df(results, embeddings):
    assert len(results) == len(embeddings)
    get_main_cat = lambda x: x if '.' not in x else x[:x.find('.')]
    return pd.DataFrame({
        'embedding': embeddings,
        'title': [r.title for r in results],
        'summary': [r.summary for r in results],
        'date': [r.published for r in results],
        'entry_id': [r.entry_id for r in results],
        'primary_category': [get_main_cat(r.primary_category) for r in results],
        'categories': [[get_main_cat(c) for c in r.categories] for r in results]
    })
```


```python
df = assemble_df(results, embeddings)
```

The embeddings have a dimension of 1536.


```python
print(f"# dimensions: {len(df.embedding.values[0])}")
```

    # dimensions: 1536
    

As we expect six clusters we choose `num_clusters=6`. As suggested by [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases), we use [K-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) and [t-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding) for reducing the dimensionality to two, making visualizations possible.


```python
matrix = np.vstack(df.embedding.values)
num_clusters = 6
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, init="k-means++", random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(matrix)
labels = kmeans.labels_
df["cluster"] = labels
```


```python
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, perplexity=15, random_state=42, init="random", learning_rate=200)
vis_dims2 = tsne.fit_transform(matrix)

x = [x for x, y in vis_dims2]
y = [y for x, y in vis_dims2]

labels = {}
for cluster in range(6):
    subset = df[df.cluster == cluster]
    freq = pd.Series(subset.primary_category.tolist()).value_counts()
    labels[cluster] = f'#{cluster}' + ', '.join([f' {cat} ({count})' for cat, count in freq[:4].items()])
labels

for cluster, color in enumerate(['tab:blue', 'tab:orange', 'tab:green', 'tab:red', 'tab:purple', 'tab:brown']):
    xs = np.array(x)[df.cluster == cluster]
    ys = np.array(y)[df.cluster == cluster]
    plt.scatter(xs, ys, color=color, alpha=0.4, label=labels[cluster])
    plt.scatter(xs.mean(), ys.mean(), marker="s", color=color, s=150)
plt.title("2D t-SNE Clusters")
fig.tight_layout()
plt.legend();
```

Results aren quite good, with cluster #0 (mathematics), cluster #3 (condensed matter) and cluster #4 (astrophysics) quite distinct. Cluster #1 (quantitative biology) is a bit dispersed over other clusters, while clusters #2 and #5 have some overlap. 

We are now ready to apply the method on articles for which we don't know the answer: here we take all the articles in the *quantitative finance* category with the word *volatility* in the title. This covers about 950 articles published from 1997 to 2023.


```python
results = query("cat:q-fin.* AND ti:volatility", None)
print(f"Found {len(results)} results.")
```

    Found 947 results.
    

The five most recent ones are the following:


```python
def to_html(results):
    text = "<table><tr><th>Publication Date</th><th></th><th style='text-align:left'>Authors and Title</th></tr>"
    for r in results:
        authors = ', '.join(a.name for a in r.authors)
        categories = ', '.join(r.categories)
        text += f"<tr><td width=100>{datetime.strftime(r.published, '%Y-%m-%d')}</td>" \
            + f"<td width=20><a style='text-decoration: none;' href='{r.entry_id}'>🔗</a></td>" \
            + f"<td style='text-align:left'><tt>{categories}</tt><br>{authors}<br><b>{r.title}</b></td></tr>"
    text += "</table>"
    display(HTML(text))
```


```python
to_html(results[0:5])
```

As done before, we compute the embeddings using title and summary. 


```python
embeddings = []
for result in results:
    embeddings.append(get_embedding(get_text(result), "text-embedding-ada-002"))
```


```python
import pickle
with open('data.pickle', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump((results, embeddings), f)
```


```python
import pickle
with open('data.pickle', 'rb') as f:
    results, embeddings = pickle.load(f)
```


```python
df = assemble_df(results, embeddings)
matrix = np.vstack(df.embedding.values)
```

Since we don't know how many clusters we have, we use the [agglomerative clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html) method.


```python
ac = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=None, distance_threshold=1.5) 
ac.fit(matrix)
labels = ac.labels_
df["cluster"] = labels
num_clusters = ac.n_clusters_
```

Instead of the t-SNE visualization, which will add little to our case, we use `gpt-4` to obtain a list of keywords that describe the clusters. We do that by collecting all the titles, without the summaries to make the request shorter, for each cluster and calling `openai.ChatCompletion.create()`.


```python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo-16k", temperature=0):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature,
    )
    return response.usage.total_tokens, response.choices[0].message["content"]
```


```python
topics = {}
for cluster in range(num_clusters):
    titles = '\n\n'.join([t for t in df[df.cluster == cluster].title])
    prompt = f"""
    You are an expert in quantitative finance and you are helping reviewing the
    titles of scientific articles.
    What are the 5 most important topics of the following titles of scientific articles.
    Return the answers as json that contains all the topics in a list under the tag "topics".

    {titles}"""
    _, response = get_completion(prompt)

    topics[cluster] = json.loads(response)['topics']
```

We report the topics as suggested by the LLM together with a few titles of the articles in the cluster.


```python
html = "<table>"
for cluster, topic in topics.items():
    t = f'#{cluster} ' + ', '.join(topic)
    articles = '<li>'.join([row.title for _, row in df[df.cluster == cluster][:10].iterrows()])
    html += f"<tr><td><b>{t} </b><ul><li>{articles} </ul></td></tr>"
html += "</table>"
display(HTML(html))
```

The work 'volatility' is in all clusters, but this shouldn't surprise given that we have selected the articles that contain it in the title! Five clusters reference 'stochastic volatility', although from different angles: cluster 1 from a modeling perspective (the SDE formulation), cluster 3 applied to option pricing, cluster 4 refers more to the smile representation, cluster 6 points to papers applying machine learning and option pricing, and cluster 7 refers to portfolio theory and portfolio selection. The distinction isn't always clear, suggesting that the clustering algorithm could be improved or fine-tuned.
