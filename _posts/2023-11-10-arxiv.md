excerpt: "Looking for similar articles using OpenAI's text embedding models"
---

In this article we look at [embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) with the aim of estimating the similarity between different texts. An embedding is a vector representation of a word or a text. The idea is to transform a set of words $T$ into a mathematical object $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, with $n$ large, say a thousand or more. Crucially, the value $n$ is the same for any $T$, irrespective of the number of words that compose it; this makes it possible to compare different texts using simple vector operations.

As concrete use case, we look at the articles published on [arxiv.org](https://www.arxiv.org); the embeddings are provided by [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com). Our goal is to detect articles that are similar to a given one.

The requires packages are the usual suspects; the only additions are the [openai](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) and the [arxiv](https://github.com/lukasschwab/arxiv.py) python packages, both easily installable with `pip`.

import pickle
import requests
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

secret_key = Path('./secret-key.txt').open('r').read()
openai.api_key = secret_key
```

Of the many models OpenAI has published, here we are interested in *text* models. There are several of them, some marked as `similarity` and others as `embedding`. The difference is that `similarity` models tend to be used for applications where two pieces of text are compared to get a similarity score as output, while `embedding` models generally take an input query and then return the top $K$ best matches from a collection of texts that was embedded into a database previously. Therefore, for what we are doing here we need `similarity`.


```python
models = openai.Model.list()
models = pd.DataFrame(models['data']).set_index('id')
models.created = pd.to_datetime(models.created, unit='s')
models[models.index.str.contains('text')].sort_values('created', ascending=False)[:10]
```

OpenAI [suggests](https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-embedding-model) to use `text-embedding-ada-002`, so this is what we will use. 
According to OpenAI, this new model unifies the specific models for text similarity, text search and code search into a single new model, and performs better than the previous embedding models across a diverse set of text search, sentence similarity, and code search benchmarks. The price at the time of writing is about 3,000 pages per dollar, which is quite cheap. An alternative would be `text-similarity-ada-001`, not displayed in the list above because released in April 2022.

Since our scope is to search for similar articles published on arxiv.org, we first need to download the salient features of the articles. We will limit ourselve to title and summary, although a deeper analysis would also focus on the article content (which needs extracing from the PDF or from the source files). The nice [arxiv](https://github.com/lukasschwab/arxiv.py) package provides an easy-to-use API for doing exactly that. The `query()` function below simply queries for the specified number of articles, sortd by update date, and returns a list with the provided metadata.


```python
def query(query, max_results, offset: int = 0):
    search = arxiv.Search(
        query=query,
        max_results=max_results,
        sort_by=arxiv.SortCriterion.LastUpdatedDate
    )
    client = arxiv.Client()
    return list(client.results(search=search, offset=offset))
```

As a first check, we query the last 50 articles in six [categories](https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy) that are quite different from each other: astrophysics, economics, condensed matter, quantitative biology and quantitative finance. In general an article on astrophysics should have little in common with one on quantitative finance or condensed matter. Overlaps may exists between economics and quantitative finance, and mathematics is used in all other sciences. To make things a bit more difficult, arxiv has a single main category as well as many secondary ones, and the query for a certain category returns articles that have that category as either the main or one of the secondary ones, so the distinction may not always be clear-cut. All considered, though, we should be able to cluster them quite nicely


```python
results = []
for cat in ['astro-ph', 'econ', 'cond-mat', 'math', 'q-bio', 'q-fin']:
    results += query(f'cat:{cat}.*', 50, offset=0)
```

We use title and summary to compute the embedding. It takes about a minute to call `get_embedding()` for the 300 articles of our tests; once computed, embeddings are stored in a dataframe together with the title.


```python
embeddings = []
for result in results:
    embeddings.append(get_embedding(result.summary.replace('\n', ' '), "text-embedding-ada-002"))
```


```python
def assemble_df(results, embeddings):
    assert len(results) == len(embeddings)
    get_main_cat = lambda x: x if '.' not in x else x[:x.find('.')]
    return pd.DataFrame({
        'embedding': embeddings,
        'title': [r.title for r in results],
        'summary': [r.summary for r in results],
        'date': [r.published for r in results],
        'entry_id': [r.entry_id for r in results],
        'primary_category': [get_main_cat(r.primary_category) for r in results],
        'categories': [[get_main_cat(c) for c in r.categories] for r in results]
    })
```


```python
df = assemble_df(results, embeddings)
```

The embeddings have a dimension of 1536.


```python
print(f"# dimensions: {len(df.embedding.values[0])}")
```

    # dimensions: 1536
    

As we expect six clusters we choose `num_clusters=6`. As suggested by [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases), we use [K-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) and [t-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding) for reducing the dimensionality to two, making visualizations possible.


```python
matrix = np.vstack(df.embedding.values)
num_clusters = 6
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, init="k-means++", random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(matrix)
labels = kmeans.labels_
df["cluster"] = labels
```


```python
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, perplexity=15, random_state=42, init="random", learning_rate=200)
vis_dims2 = tsne.fit_transform(matrix)

x = [x for x, y in vis_dims2]
y = [y for x, y in vis_dims2]

for category, color in enumerate(['tab:blue', 'tab:orange', 'tab:green', 'tab:red', 'tab:purple', 'tab:brown']):
    xs = np.array(x)[df.cluster == category]
    ys = np.array(y)[df.cluster == category]
    plt.scatter(xs, ys, color=color, alpha=0.4, label=f'cluster #{category}')
    plt.scatter(xs.mean(), ys.mean(), marker="s", color=color, s=150)
plt.title("2D t-SNE Clusters")
fig.tight_layout()
plt.legend();
```

Results aren't too bad, with cluster 0 being astrophysics, cluster 4 condensed matter, and cluster 5 mathematics. Clusters 1, 2 and 3, instead are a bit more mixed up; from the picture above, clusters 1 and 3 are quite interconnected. 


```python
for cluster in range(6):
    print(f'Cluster {cluster}:', end='')
    subset = df[df.cluster == cluster]
    freq = pd.Series(subset.primary_category.tolist()).value_counts()
    for cat, count in freq[:4].items():
        print(f' {cat}: {count}', end='')
    print()
```

    Cluster 0: astro-ph: 39 gr-qc: 6 hep-th: 1
    Cluster 1: econ: 30 cs: 6 q-bio: 4 math: 3
    Cluster 2: q-bio: 18 cs: 15 econ: 6 quant-ph: 2
    Cluster 3: econ: 24 q-fin: 19 math: 5 cs: 5
    Cluster 4: cond-mat: 37 physics: 9 q-bio: 3 nucl-th: 1
    Cluster 5: math: 36 cond-mat: 4 econ: 3 q-bio: 3
    

We are now ready to apply the method on articles for which we don't know the answer: here we take the last 2,000 articles in the *quantitative finance* category, *mathematical finance* subcategory. This covers the articles published from 2016 to 2023.


```python
results = query("cat:q-fin.mf", 2_000)
```

The five most recent ones are the following:


```python
def to_html(results):
    text = "<table><tr><th>Publication Date</th><th></th><th style='text-align:left'>Authors and Title</th></tr>"
    for r in results:
        authors = ', '.join(a.name for a in r.authors)
        categories = ', '.join(r.categories)
        text += f"<tr><td width=100>{datetime.strftime(r.published, '%Y-%m-%d')}</td>" \
            + f"<td width=20><a style='text-decoration: none;' href='{r.entry_id}'>🔗</a></td>" \
            + f"<td style='text-align:left'><tt>{categories}</tt><br>{authors}<br><b>{r.title}</b></td></tr>"
    text += "</table>"
    display(HTML(text))


to_html(results[0:5])
```

We will repeat the procedure done above: we compute the embedding for each result and store it into a dataframe, then use K-means to cluster them.


```python
embeddings = []
for result in results:
    embeddings.append(get_embedding(result.summary, "text-similarity-ada-001"))
```


```python
df = assemble_df(results, embeddings)
matrix = np.vstack(df.embedding.values)
```


```python
num_clusters = 9
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, init="k-means++", random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(matrix)
labels = kmeans.labels_
df["cluster"] = labels
```

We don't visualize but rather print a few articles for each cluster.


```python
for cluster in range(num_clusters):
    print(f'⇒ cluster #{cluster}')
    for i, row in df[df.cluster == cluster][:5].iterrows():
        print(row.title)
    print()
```

A better and more useful way of testing the similarity is to look for similar articles. We select an article that sits in between deep hedging and synthetic market data generation and search for other similar articles.


```python
selected_title = 'A Data-driven Market Simulator for Small Data Environments'
selected_id = df.index[df.title == selected_title].values[0]
print(f'Cluster: {df.loc[selected_id].cluster}\nTitle: {df.loc[selected_id].title}\nSummary: {df.loc[selected_id].summary}')
```

    Title: A Data-driven Market Simulator for Small Data Environments
    Summary: Neural network based data-driven market simulation unveils a new and flexible
    way of modelling financial time series without imposing assumptions on the
    underlying stochastic dynamics. Though in this sense generative market
    simulation is model-free, the concrete modelling choices are nevertheless
    decisive for the features of the simulated paths. We give a brief overview of
    currently used generative modelling approaches and performance evaluation
    metrics for financial time series, and address some of the challenges to
    achieve good results in the latter. We also contrast some classical approaches
    of market simulation with simulation based on generative modelling and
    highlight some advantages and pitfalls of the new approach. While most
    generative models tend to rely on large amounts of training data, we present
    here a generative model that works reliably in environments where the amount of
    available training data is notoriously small. Furthermore, we show how a rough
    paths perspective combined with a parsimonious Variational Autoencoder
    framework provides a powerful way for encoding and evaluating financial time
    series in such environments where available training data is scarce. Finally,
    we also propose a suitable performance evaluation metric for financial time
    series and discuss some connections of our Market Generator to deep hedging.

selected = df.loc[selected_id].embedding
df['similarity'] = df.embedding.apply(lambda x: cosine_similarity(x, selected))

    if i == selected_id:
        continue

The similarity level is always quite high, above 0.90, suggesting that perhaps the texts above are all quite similar in general terms, so similarity alone may not suffice. Still, we manage to find relevant articles, as one could see by looking at the references in the one we have selected or in the list of articles that cite it, or by the publications of the authors. References, citations and authors are easily available and in a real-life applications we would surely use them to increase the precision of the suggestions, together with the content from the article.
