excerpt: "Some experiments on the image styles that can be obtained."
---

We have explored the generation of [text](/openai) and also [images](/story-telling) in two previous articles; in this one, we explore the image generation capabilities of [DALL-E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3). As of November 2023, in my tests DALL-E 3 produces images that are much more sophisticated and nicer than other tools, including [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2) and [Deep AI](https://deepai.org/). (I haven't tried [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home) because it requires a paid subscription, although its images look quite impresive.)

We start by using the OpenAI API directly.


```python
from IPython.display import HTML, Markdown
import openai
from pathlib import Path
import pickle
import requests
import wikipedia
```

ChatGPT requires a paid subscription; the secret key is stored in a file.


```python
secret_key = Path('./secret-key.txt').open('r').read()
openai.api_key = secret_key
```

The API is very easy to use: call `openai.Image.create()` with a given prompt. We need to specify the model and the size; we start with DALL-E 2 to better appreciate what an improvement DALL-E 3 is. The response contains the URL of the image do download.


```python
prompt_text = "envision a chessboard, liquid metal and crystal, on a table in a futuristic scenario"
```


```python
response = openai.Image.create(
  model="dall-e-2",
  prompt=prompt_text,
  n=1,
  size="1024x1024"
)

assert len(response['data']) == 1
url = response['data'][0]['url']

filename = 'chess-2.png'
img_data = requests.get(url).content
with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
    f.write(img_data)
```

<img src='/assets/images/dall-e-3/chess-2.png' />


```python
response = openai.Image.create(
  model="dall-e-3",
  prompt=prompt_text,
  n=1,
  size="1024x1024"
)

assert len(response['data']) == 1
revised_prompt = response['data'][0]['revised_prompt']
url = response['data'][0]['url']

filename = 'chess-3.png'
img_data = requests.get(url).content
with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
    f.write(img_data)

display(HTML("<b>Revised prompt</b>:<br><br>"+ revised_prompt))
```


<b>Revised prompt</b>:<br><br>Imagine a futuristic scene where a chessboard made of liquid metal and crystal pieces is situated on a sleek, modern table. The entire setting should look advanced and ahead of its time, with elements such as holographic screens and neon lights in the background. The liquid metal should appear as if it's in constant flux, reshaping itself, while the crystal pieces brilliantly reflect the ambient lighting. The atmosphere is charged with anticipation, as if a strategic battle of wits is about to take place on this unique, dynamic chessboard.


<img src='/assets/images/dall-e-3/chess-3.png' />

For the remainder of this article we have used BingChat to generate the images. Looking at the web, I came up with a long list of artistic styles; for each of them, the prompt is

```
Prompt: a picture of a window with mountains and sunset, style is #style
```

This prompt was selected after some experiments: being quite general and a common subject for pictures and photigraphs, it produces good results for each style, while other prompts were found to generate inconclusive or misleading images for some styles. The approach is the following: on the Bing, the prompt above was used to generate several pictures; a screenshot of the results was taken and saved to a PNG file. Then, we load all such files and for each of them we ask ChatGPT, through the Python API, to provide a short description of the style itself. Finally, an HTML text with the description and the image is produced and displayed.

We use ChatGPT 4; the temperature is zero because we want precise results, not creativity.


```python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-4", temperature=0):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature,
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```


```python
images = [f.stem for f in Path('.').glob('*.png')]
styles = [i.replace('-', ' ') for i in images]
```


```python
def get_description(style):
    prompt = f"""
    Write a short description of the figurative style {style}. Use about 200 words.
    Format the result as plain text. Report the period of interest and the most important
    people.
    """
    return get_completion(style)
```

Since each query can taken 10 to 30 seconds and we need to paid for them, results are cached in a pickle file. This makes adding a new style easy and quick.


```python
descriptions_file = Path('./descriptions.pickle')
if descriptions_file.exists():
    with open(descriptions_file, 'rb') as f:
        descriptions = pickle.load(f)
else:
    descriptions = {}
modified = False
for style in styles:
    if style not in descriptions:
        descriptions[style] = get_description(style)
    modified = True
if modified:
    with open(descriptions_file, 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(descriptions, f)
```

The HTML itself is quite basic; we use a purple color to identify the text produced by ChatGPT. Not all prompts are correct descriptions on the style, but overall they are quite good.


```python
html = ""
for style, image in zip(styles, images):
    description = descriptions[style]
    html += f"""
<hr>
<h4>{style.title()}</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">{description}</p>

<br>
<img src='{image}.png' width=600 />
"""
```

And this is the result: quite a lot to read and a nice introduction to many artistic styles. 


```python
display(HTML(html))
```

<h4>Abstract Expressionism</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">Abstract Expressionism is an art movement that emerged in the United States after World War II during the 1940s and 1950s. It is known for its emphasis on spontaneous, automatic, or subconscious creation. The movement is often characterized by gestural brush-strokes or mark-making, and the impression of spontaneity.

The artists involved in this movement placed emphasis on the physical act of painting, often using large canvases and involving their whole body in the process. They believed that the process of creating art was just as important, if not more so, than the final product.

Abstract Expressionism is often divided into two groups: Action Painting (including artists like Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning) which focused on the physical action of painting, and Color Field Painting (including artists like Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman) which was more concerned with exploring the effects of pure color on a canvas.

The movement was the first to put New York City at the forefront of the art world, a status previously held by Paris. Abstract Expressionism is considered a pivotal moment in the shift of the cultural center of the art world from Paris to New York.</p>

<h4>American Realism</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">American Realism is a style of art and literature that emerged in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is characterized by its focus on everyday life, ordinary people, and the social issues of the time. 

In literature, American Realism was a response to the romanticism and transcendentalism of the earlier 19th century. It rejected the idealized, symbolic, and supernatural elements of these movements, instead favoring detailed, accurate descriptions of the real world. Notable authors in this genre include Mark Twain, Henry James, and Edith Wharton.

In art, American Realism is often associated with the Ashcan School, a group of artists who sought to depict the gritty reality of urban life. They painted scenes of crowded city streets, tenement houses, and the working class. Notable artists in this movement include Robert Henri, George Bellows, and Edward Hopper.

American Realism also extended to theater, with playwrights like Eugene O'Neill and Arthur Miller focusing on the struggles and conflicts of ordinary people.

Overall, American Realism sought to portray life as it truly was, without romanticizing or idealizing it. It was a reflection of the social, political, and economic changes happening in the United States at the time.</p>

<h4>Ancient Egypt Fourth Millenium</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">The fourth millennium BC in Ancient Egypt is generally recognized as the period when the civilization really began to take shape. This period, also known as the Predynastic period, saw the development of many of the institutions, practices, and cultural elements that would characterize Ancient Egyptian civilization for the next three millennia.

During this time, the Egyptians began to develop a system of writing, known as hieroglyphics, and they also began to build monumental structures, including the famous pyramids. The society was becoming increasingly complex, with a growing division of labor and the emergence of a ruling class.

The fourth millennium BC also saw the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt into a single kingdom, traditionally attributed to the pharaoh Narmer. This event, which took place around 3100 BC, marked the beginning of the Pharaonic period of Egyptian history.

The fourth millennium BC was also a time of significant technological advancement. The Egyptians developed advanced techniques for agriculture, pottery, and metalworking, among other things. They also began to use the Nile River for transportation and trade, which greatly increased their economic power and influence.

Overall, the fourth millennium BC was a time of great change and development in Ancient Egypt, setting the stage for the civilization's golden age in the centuries to come.</p>

<h4>Ancient Egypt Second Millenium</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">The second millennium BC in Ancient Egypt spans the period from 2000 BC to 1001 BC, covering the end of the Old Kingdom and the First Intermediate Period, the Middle Kingdom, and the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period.

1. End of the Old Kingdom and the First Intermediate Period (2181–2055 BC): This period was marked by political instability and decline in centralized power. The Old Kingdom collapsed under the weight of economic hardship, internal strife, and invasion from foreign lands.

2. Middle Kingdom (2055–1650 BC): This period is often considered the high point of Ancient Egyptian culture. The Middle Kingdom was marked by a resurgence in centralized power, a flourishing of the arts, and advances in architecture, literature, and agriculture. The Pharaohs of this period were known for their benevolence and concern for the people.

3. Beginning of the Second Intermediate Period (1650–1550 BC): This period was marked by the invasion of the Hyksos, a foreign people from the Near East. The Hyksos established their own dynasty and ruled over the northern part of Egypt, while native Egyptian rulers maintained control over the southern part.

Throughout the second millennium BC, Ancient Egypt experienced periods of prosperity and decline, but it remained one of the most advanced civilizations of the ancient world.</p>

<h4>Ancient Egypt Third Millenium</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">The third millennium BC in Ancient Egypt spans the Early Bronze Age from around 3100 BC to 2000 BC. This period is marked by significant advancements in Egyptian civilization across various aspects such as culture, technology, religion, and politics.

1. Early Dynastic Period (3100-2686 BC): This period saw the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first Pharaoh, Narmer. The hieroglyphic script was developed during this time, and there was significant architectural development, including the construction of the first royal tombs.

2. Old Kingdom (2686-2181 BC): Also known as the "Age of the Pyramids," this period is marked by the construction of the Great Pyramids of Giza. The Pharaohs during this time were considered gods, and there was a strong central government. The sun god Ra was worshipped extensively.

3. First Intermediate Period (2181-2055 BC): This period was marked by political instability and decentralization of power. There was a decline in the Pharaoh's authority, leading to civil wars and chaos.

4. Middle Kingdom (2055-1650 BC): This period saw the reunification of Egypt and a resurgence in art, literature, and architecture. The Pharaohs of this period were considered shepherds of their people rather than gods.

Throughout the third millennium BC, Ancient Egypt made significant advancements in irrigation, farming, and construction techniques. The civilization also developed a complex religious system, a form of government, and a written language, which were all crucial to its growth and development.</p>

<h4>Ancient Rome First Century</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">The first century in Ancient Rome, spanning from 1 AD to 100 AD, was a period of significant growth and change for the Roman Empire. This era was marked by the rule of several notable emperors, including Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero.

In 14 AD, Augustus, the first Roman Emperor, died and was succeeded by his stepson Tiberius. This marked the beginning of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, which would rule Rome until 68 AD. 

The first century also saw the expansion of the Roman Empire, with conquests in Britain and the Middle East. The Roman army was at its peak, and Roman law, architecture, and culture flourished.

However, this period was also marked by political instability and corruption, particularly during the reigns of emperors like Caligula and Nero. There were several revolts and conspiracies against the emperors, and the Roman Senate struggled to maintain its power and influence.

In terms of religion, the first century saw the spread of Christianity, which began as a small sect within Judaism in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. Despite facing persecution, Christianity continued to grow and would eventually become the dominant religion of the empire.

By the end of the first century, the Roman Empire had reached its greatest extent, stretching from Britain in the west to Mesopotamia in the east. However, the empire was also facing increasing internal and external pressures that would lead to its eventual decline and fall.</p>

<h4>Ancient Rome Third Century</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">The third century in Ancient Rome, spanning from 201 to 300 AD, was a period of great turmoil and crisis, often referred to as the Crisis of the Third Century or the Imperial Crisis. This period was marked by economic collapse, invasions, civil wars, and the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

1. Economic Crisis: The Roman economy suffered from inflation, a declining population, and a decrease in trade. The silver content of the Roman denarius was reduced to almost zero, leading to a loss of confidence in the currency.

2. Military Crisis: The Roman Empire faced invasions from various barbarian tribes such as the Goths, Persians, and Alamanni. The Roman army was overstretched and unable to effectively defend the vast borders of the empire.

3. Political Crisis: The third century saw a rapid turnover of emperors, with 26 claimants to the throne in a 50-year period. This instability led to frequent civil wars and power struggles.

4. Social Crisis: The crisis also had social implications, with a decline in urban life, a decrease in literacy, and a rise in superstition and belief in magic.

5. Diocletian's Reforms: In the late third century, Emperor Diocletian attempted to address these crises through a series of reforms. He divided the empire into a tetrarchy (rule of four), with two senior emperors (Augusti) and two junior emperors (Caesars). He also introduced economic reforms to stabilize the currency and increased the size of the army.

6. Spread of Christianity: The third century also saw the continued spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire. Despite periods of persecution, the religion grew in popularity and influence.

By the end of the third century, the Roman Empire had begun to stabilize, setting the stage for the reign of Constantine the Great in the fourth century. However, the crises of the third century had lasting impacts and contributed to the eventual fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century.</p>

<h4>Art Nouveau</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">Art Nouveau is an international style of art, architecture, and applied art, especially the decorative arts, known in different languages by different names. It was most popular between 1890 and 1910. It was a reaction against the academic art, eclecticism and historicism of 19th century architecture and decoration. 

Art Nouveau is characterized by its use of a long, sinuous, organic line and was employed most often in architecture, interior design, jewelry and glass design, posters, and illustration. It was a deliberate attempt to create a new style, free of the imitative historicism that dominated much of 19th-century art and design. 

The style was named after Maison de l'Art Nouveau, a Parisian shop opened in 1895 by the dealer Siegfried Bing, which showcased works in the style. Notable artists associated with Art Nouveau include Alphonse Mucha, Gustav Klimt, and Antoni Gaudí.</p>

<h4>Aztec</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">The Aztec civilization was a Mesoamerican culture that flourished in central Mexico in the post-classic period from 1300 to 1521. The Aztec culture is generally grouped with the cultural complex known as the Nahuas, because the cultural traits of this group were similar.

The Aztec civilization was incredibly advanced in many ways, with a rich and complex mythology and cultural heritage. They were known for their architectural and artistic accomplishments, as well as their complex social, political, and religious institutions. They built massive stone structures, including temples, palaces, and public plazas, all without the use of metal tools.

The Aztecs are also known for their agricultural innovations, such as the chinampa system, which allowed them to create fertile gardens on the surface of lakes and swamps. They also developed a complex system of canals for irrigation and transportation.

The Aztec society was highly stratified, with a ruling class, a warrior class, a merchant class, and a large class of commoners who were farmers, laborers, and slaves. The Aztec economy was based on agriculture and trade, and they used a system of barter for most transactions.

The Aztec civilization came to an end in the 16th century when Spanish conquerors led by Hernán Cortés, allied with other indigenous peoples of the region, captured the emperor Cuauhtémoc and defeated the Aztec army. Despite their downfall, the Aztecs left a lasting legacy and continue to influence Mexican culture to this day.</p>

<h4>Bauhaus</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">Bauhaus was a revolutionary German art and design school that operated from 1919 to 1933. Founded by architect Walter Gropius, the school sought to combine crafts and the fine arts, and was famous for its approach to design, which attempted to unify the principles of mass production with individual artistic vision and strove to combine aesthetics with everyday function.

The Bauhaus style, also known as the International Style, was marked by the absence of ornamentation and by harmony between the function of an object or a building and its design. It had a profound influence upon subsequent developments in art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, industrial design, and typography.

The school was closed by its own leadership under pressure from the Nazi regime, having been painted as a centre of communist intellectualism. Despite its closure, the Bauhaus had a major impact both in Europe and the United States long after it closed.</p>

<h4>Constructivism</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">Constructivism is a theory in education and psychology that suggests individuals construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world through experiences and reflection on those experiences. It posits that learning is an active, constructive process where learners are encouraged to construct their own knowledge, and that learning is most effective when a learner is actively engaged in the learning process rather than passively receiving information.

In a broader philosophical context, constructivism is the view that all knowledge is constructed, rather than discovered or "found". It asserts that individuals create or construct their own new understandings or knowledge through the interaction of what they already know and believe and the ideas, events, and activities with which they come into contact. 

There are several branches of constructivism, including social constructivism, radical constructivism, and cognitive constructivism, each with its own nuances and interpretations of the theory.</p>

<h4>Cubism</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">Cubism is an artistic style developed in the early 20th century, characterized by the depiction of natural forms as geometric structures of planes. It was pioneered by artists like Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Cubism broke away from the traditional techniques of perspective, modeling, and foreshortening, and instead used simple geometric shapes to represent objects from multiple angles simultaneously. This revolutionary approach had a profound impact on modern art, influencing a range of movements and styles.</p>

It often features a dystopian society, where large corporations have significant control over the lives of individuals. The genre is known for its focus on "high tech and low life," featuring advanced technology and science, such as information technology and cybernetics, juxtaposed with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the social order. Cyberpunk plots often center on a conflict among hackers, artificial intelligences, and mega-corporations, and tend to be set in a near-future Earth, rather than the far-future settings or galactic vistas found in novels such as Isaac Asimov's Foundation or Frank Herbert's Dune. The settings are usually post-industrial dystopias but tend to feature extraordinary cultural ferment and the use of technology in ways never anticipated by its original inventors.</p>

<h4>Enamel</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">Enamel is the hard, outermost layer that covers the crown of the teeth. It is the hardest substance in the human body and is primarily made up of hydroxyapatite, a crystalline calcium phosphate. Enamel protects the sensitive inner layers of the teeth from decay, temperature sensitivity, and wear and tear. It is also responsible for the white appearance of the teeth. Despite its strength, enamel can be damaged by decay, acids from food and drink, and physical trauma.</p>

<h4>Etching</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">Etching is a printmaking technique that uses chemical action to produce incised lines in a metal printing plate which then hold the applied ink and form the image. The plate, traditionally copper but now usually zinc, is prepared with an acid-resistant ground. Lines are drawn through the ground, exposing the metal. The plate is then immersed in acid and the exposed metal is bitten, producing incised lines. Stronger acid and longer exposure produce more deeply bitten lines. The resist is removed and ink applied to the sunken lines, but wiped from the surface. The plate is then placed against paper and run through a printing press with great pressure to transfer the ink from the recessed lines. Sometimes ink may be left on the plate surface to provide a background tone.</p>

<h4>Inca</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">The Inca Empire, also known as the Incan Empire and the Inka Empire, was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America. Its political and administrative structure is considered by most scholars to have been the most developed in the Americas before Columbus' arrival. The administrative, political and military center of the empire was located in the city of Cusco in modern-day Peru.

The Inca civilization arose from the Peruvian highlands sometime in the early 13th century. Its last stronghold was conquered by the Spanish in 1572. From 1438 to 1533, the Incas incorporated a large portion of western South America, centered on the Andean Mountains, using conquest and peaceful assimilation, among other methods.

The Inca were known for their unique architecture, road systems, and social organization. They also developed a centralized economy and a complex religion. The Quechua language was the official language of the empire, and many elements of Inca culture still survive today among the Quechua-speaking populations of Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Colombia.</p>

And words are the jewels in the crown he brings,
Where every line is a path, every word a door,
To the lyrical land, where poetry is the core.</p>

<h4>Neo Impressionism</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">Neo-Impressionism is an art movement that began in the late 19th century as a response to the loose brushwork and use of light in Impressionism. The movement was pioneered by artists like Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, who sought to develop a more scientific approach to painting.

Neo-Impressionists used a technique called pointillism, or divisionism, where they applied small dots or strokes of pure color to their canvases. The idea was that these colors would blend in the viewer's eye, creating a more vibrant and luminous effect.

The movement was not just about a new painting technique, but also embraced ideas about the harmony of color and the emotional and symbolic expressions of color. Neo-Impressionism had a significant influence on the development of modern art, particularly on movements like Fauvism and Cubism.</p>

<h4>Orphism Art</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">Orphism art, also known as Orphic Cubism, is an offshoot of the Cubist art movement that was pioneered by artists Robert Delaunay and Sonia Delaunay around 1912. The term Orphism was coined by French poet Guillaume Apollinaire.

Orphism art is characterized by its use of strong colors and geometric shapes. The movement was noted for its use of abstract, often geometric, representation and vibrant colors. Unlike Cubism, which was more focused on different perspectives, Orphism was more concerned with color harmonies and lyrical qualities.

The movement was named after Orpheus, the musician and poet from ancient Greek mythology, symbolizing the artist's pursuit of pure abstraction and harmony. The Orphists believed that painting could be like music, and sought to create work that appealed to the senses in a similar way that music does.</p>

<h4>Ottoman Empire Sixteenth Century</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">The Ottoman Empire in the sixteenth century, also known as the era of transformation, was one of the most powerful states in the world. This period is often referred to as the "Golden Age" of the Ottoman Empire. It was during this time that the empire reached its peak in terms of territorial expansion and cultural production.

The empire was ruled by a series of strong and capable sultans during this period, including Selim I and Suleiman the Magnificent. Under their leadership, the empire expanded significantly, conquering large parts of the Middle East, North Africa, and Southeast Europe.

Suleiman the Magnificent, who reigned from 1520 to 1566, is often considered the greatest of the Ottoman sultans. His rule was marked by significant military victories, legal reform, and cultural advancements. He was known for his patronage of the arts, and under his rule, Istanbul became a major center of Renaissance art, literature, and architecture.

The sixteenth century also saw the height of the Ottoman naval power, with the empire controlling key trade routes in the Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf. The empire's economy flourished, with trade and agriculture serving as the main sources of wealth.

However, towards the end of the century, the empire began to face challenges. The long wars with the Habsburgs in Europe and the Safavids in Persia drained the empire's resources. Additionally, the death of Suleiman the Magnificent led to a period of less capable leadership, and the empire began to decline in the late sixteenth century.

Despite these challenges, the sixteenth century is still considered the height of the Ottoman Empire's power and influence, with lasting impacts on the regions it controlled.</p>

<h4>Persian Eleventh Century</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">The Persian eleventh century corresponds to the period from 1001 to 1100 in the Gregorian calendar. During this time, Persia (modern-day Iran) was under the rule of several dynasties including the Ghaznavids, the Seljuks, and the Khwarazmians.

This period was marked by significant developments in various fields such as science, literature, philosophy, and art. The Persian polymath and philosopher, Avicenna (Ibn Sina), who is considered one of the most significant thinkers and writers of the Islamic Golden Age, lived during this century. His works, particularly "The Canon of Medicine" and "The Book of Healing," had a profound influence on the development of medicine and philosophy.

The Seljuk Empire, which was one of the most powerful empires in the world during the 11th century, contributed to the spread of Persian language and culture across their territories. The Seljuks also played a crucial role in the revival of Sunni Islam and the decline of Shia Islam in Persia.

In terms of architecture, the 11th century saw the construction of many mosques, madrasas (Islamic schools), and caravanserais (roadside inns). The distinctive Persian-Islamic architecture style, characterized by the use of intricate geometric designs and calligraphy, flourished during this period.</p>

<h4>Pop Art</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States during the mid- to late-1950s. The movement presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular and mass culture, such as advertising, comic books, and mundane cultural objects. One of its aims is to use images of popular (as opposed to elitist) culture in art, emphasizing the banal or kitschy elements of any culture, most often through the use of irony. It is also associated with the artists' use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques. Some of the most famous pop artists include Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Richard Hamilton.</p>

<h4>Post Impressionism</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">Post-Impressionism is an art movement that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a reaction against Impressionism. It was led by artists like Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, and Georges Seurat. 

While the Impressionists sought to capture the naturalistic effects of light and color in their work, Post-Impressionists pushed the boundaries of color and form to express their subjective emotions and symbolic meanings. They used vivid and often unnatural colors, distinctive brushstrokes, and real-life subject matter, but were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, distort form for expressive effect, and use unnatural or arbitrary color.

The term "Post-Impressionism" was coined by the British artist and art critic Roger Fry in 1906. Despite the diversity of styles and techniques within the movement, Post-Impressionism has had a significant impact on the development of modern art.</p>

<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">Postmodernism is a broad movement that developed in the mid- to late 20th century across philosophy, the arts, architecture, and criticism, marking a departure from modernism. It is generally defined by an attitude of skepticism, irony, or rejection toward grand narratives, ideologies, and various tenets of universalism, including objective notions of reason, human nature, social progress, moral universalism, absolute truth, and objective reality. Instead, it asserts that knowledge and truth are products of social, historical, and political interpretations, and are therefore contextual and constructed. In art and architecture, it is characterized by the use of unconventional and experimental designs, often blending different styles and forms.</p>

<h4>Steampunk</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">Steampunk is a subgenre of science fiction that incorporates technology and aesthetic designs inspired by 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery. It is often set in an alternative history of the 19th century's British Victorian era or American "Wild West", in a post-apocalyptic future during which steam power has maintained mainstream usage, or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power.

Steampunk may also incorporate additional elements from the genres of fantasy, horror, historical fiction, alternate history, or other branches of speculative fiction. The term steampunk's first known appearance was in 1987, but it now retroactively refers to many works of fiction created as far back as the 1950s or 1960s.

Steampunk also refers to any of the artistic styles, clothing fashions, or subcultures that have developed from the aesthetics of steampunk fiction, Victorian-era fiction, art nouveau design, and films from the mid-20th century. Various modern utilitarian objects have been modded by individual artisans into a pseudo-Victorian mechanical "steampunk" style, and a number of visual and musical artists have been described as steampunk.</p>

<h4>Victorian England</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #880E4F">Victorian England refers to the period of British history during the reign of Queen Victoria from 1837 to 1901. This era was characterized by significant changes and developments in nearly every aspect of society.

In terms of politics, the Victorian era saw the expansion of the British Empire, making it the most powerful global empire during this time. It was also a period of significant political reform, with the introduction of new laws and policies that expanded voting rights, improved social conditions, and promoted public education.

The Victorian era was also a time of great cultural and intellectual activity. Literature, art, and science flourished during this time, with notable figures such as Charles Dickens, the Bronte sisters, Thomas Hardy, Charles Darwin, and many others making significant contributions to their respective fields.

The Industrial Revolution, which had begun in the late 18th century, continued to transform the economy and society. This led to rapid urbanization, with many people moving to cities to work in factories. However, this also led to overcrowded living conditions, pollution, and other social problems.

Socially, the Victorian era was characterized by strict moral standards and codes of conduct. The family was considered the cornerstone of society, and women were expected to focus on domestic duties and raising children. However, the latter part of the era saw the beginnings of the women's suffrage movement.

Despite the progress and prosperity of the Victorian era, it was also a time of great inequality and social unrest. The gap between the rich and the poor was vast, and there were frequent protests and strikes by workers demanding better conditions and rights. 

Overall, the Victorian era was a time of great change and contradiction, marked by progress and innovation as well as social and economic inequality.</p>

I find this a very easy and convenient way to learn a bit about the different artistic styles: having the same image depicted differently allows a quick comparison. Not quite an art course, but a nice introduction, to be followed by proper, human-written, art books!
