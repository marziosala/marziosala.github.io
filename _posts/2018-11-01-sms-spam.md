excerpt: "Logistic regression applied to the SMS spam dataset."
---

In this article we look at the [SMS spam collection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) dataset. This dataset contains 5,574 tagged SMS messages in English that have been collected for SMS Spam research, labeled acording being ham (legitimate) or spam. This dataset is tiny for today's standards, however it is easy to get reasonable results with simple methods. We will apply logistic regression to perform binary classification using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) and minimal computer power.


```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score
```

Ordinary linear regression assumes that the response variable is normally distributed. In logistic regression, the response variable describes the probability that the outcome is the positive case. If the response variable is equal to or exceeds a discrimination threshold, the positive class is prediceted; otherwise, the negative class is predicted. The response variable is modeled as a function of a linear combination of the explanatory variables using the **logistic function**, defined as

$$
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}},
$$

whose output is always in $[0, 1]$. The inverse of the logistic function is called the **logit function**.


```python
df = pd.read_csv('SMSSpamCollection', delimiter='\t', header=None)
```


```python
df.head()
```

      <td>U dun say so early hor... U c already then say...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>ham</td>
      <td>Nah I don't think he goes to usf, he lives aro...</td>
    </tr>

</div>




```python
counts = df[0].value_counts()
print(f"# ham: {counts['ham']}, # spam: {counts['spam']}")
```

    # ham: 4825, # spam: 747
    

By default, `train_test_split()` assignes 25% of the samples to the training set.


```python
X_train_raw, X_test_raw, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df[1], df[0], random_state=0)
```

Next, we create a `TfidVectorizer`, which combines `CountVectorizer` and `TfidTransformer`. The fitting is applied to the training set and applied to both the training and the testing sets.


```python
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train_raw)
X_test = vectorizer.transform(X_test_raw)
```


```python
classifier = LogisticRegression()
_ = classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
```


```python
score_train = classifier.score(X_train, y_train)
score_test = classifier.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Score on the train set = {score_train:.2%}, on the test set = {score_test:.2%}")
```

    Score on the train set = 97.32%, on the test set = 97.06%
    

A variety of metrics exist to evaluate the performance of binary classifiers against trusted labels. The most commonly used are:

- accuracy;
- precision;
- F1 measure;
- ROC AUC score.

All those measures depend on the concepts of **true positives**, **true negatives**, **false positives** and **false negatives**, where positive and negative depend on the classes, and true and false denote whether the predicted class is the same as the true class. The **confusion matrix** can be used to visualize those values.


```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
```

A 'negative' is when we don't detect a `spam` (that is, `ham`), a 'positive' is when we detect a spam.


```python
labels = ['ham', 'spam']
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred, labels=labels)
```


```python
pd.DataFrame(cm, columns=labels, index=labels)
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }

<table border="1" class="dataframe">

    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>ham</th>
      <th>spam</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>ham</th>
      <td>1206</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>spam</th>
      <td>39</td>
      <td>146</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



As we see from the confusion matrix, only two `ham` messages were wrongly classified as `spam`, while we have 39 `spam` messages that were not properly classified. Let's give a look at those messages.


```python
from IPython.display import HTML
```


```python
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
css = 'background-color: FireBrick; font-family: Lucida Console;'

bad_spam, bad_ham = '', ''
for i, prediction in enumerate(y_pred):
    exact = y_test.iloc[i]
    if prediction == exact:
        continue
    if exact == 'ham':
        bad_ham += f'<p style="{css}">{X_test_raw.iloc[i]}</p>'
    else:
        bad_spam += f'<p style="{css}">{X_test_raw.iloc[i]}</p>'
```

Here we have the two messages that are `ham` but were wrongly classified as `spam`:


```python
HTML(bad_ham)
```




<p style="background-color: FireBrick; font-family: Lucida Console;">U can call now...</p><p style="background-color: FireBrick; font-family: Lucida Console;">Are you free now?can i call now?</p>



And now the 39 spam messages that were not properly classified:


```python
HTML(bad_spam)
```
