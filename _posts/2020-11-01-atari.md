An introduction to OpenAI Gym environments for Atari 2600.

In this post we will show some basic configurations and commands for the OpenAI Gym Atari environments. These environments are based on the [Arcade Learning Environment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.4708.pdf), or ALE, a project that provides the interfaces to hundreds of Atari 2600 games. The idea is to have cool and interesting problems to solve, and get nice visualizations, too. More than five hundred games were produced for this console, which was quite popular for about a decade after being released in 1977; the production of the 2600 series ended in 1992. The games are quite simple by today's standard, both in the graphics but also in the controls. They are also typically quick to play, and hence not too difficult to understand and learn. The original CPU ran at 1.19 MHz (yes, mega, not giga) and it can be emulated faster than real-time on modern hardware. Even more interesting for today's standard, the console had [128 bytes of RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600#Console) for scratch space, the call stack, and the state of the game environment.

I have installed `gym[atari]` and the `retro` packages, followed by the importing of [several ROMS](http://www.atarimania.com/rom_collection_archive_atari_2600_roms.html). Not that everything was a smooth ride, especially on Windows 10, but with some efforts and quite a few suggestions from various web pages I was able to have it up and running. The goal here is to load all the Atari packages, generate a big image with a snapshot from most of them, and play one game with a random strategy, which is enough for a simple animation.


```python
import gym
import retro
from tqdm.notebook import trange, tqdm
import matplotlib.pylab as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
```

After importing the ROMS we should have a bit less than 900 environments.


```python
all_envs = gym.envs.registry.all()
env_ids = [env_spec.id for env_spec in all_envs]
print(f"Found {len(env_ids)} environments")
```

    Found 859 environments
    

Not all environments can be instantiated, at least for my installation -- Linux would have been a better choice probably. The bad environments are generally the MuJoCo ones, as this is a commercial product for which I have no license. I've also noticed problems loading several `PyBullet` environments as in the loop below, while single imports went fine.


```python
# will take a couple of minutes
bad = []
action_space_types = []
observation_space_types = []
for env_id in (pbar := tqdm(env_ids)):
    pbar.set_description(env_id)
    if 'Defender' in env_id:
        # those games don't load for me, there is a bug in the current version of the atari-py package
        continue
    try:
        env = gym.make(env_id)
        action_space_types.append(type(env.action_space))
        observation_space_types.append(type(env.observation_space))
        env.close()
    except Exception as e:
        bad.append(env_id)
```


    HBox(children=(HTML(value=''), FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=859.0), HTML(value='')))


    c:\users\dragh\.conda\envs\rl\lib\site-packages\gym\logger.py:30: UserWarning: [33mWARN: Box bound precision lowered by casting to float32[0m
      warnings.warn(colorize('%s: %s'%('WARN', msg % args), 'yellow'))
    

    
    

What we do next is to manually select 60 environments for which we can generate a nice image.


```python
selected_env_ids = [
    'Adventure-v0',
    'Alien-v0',
    'Amidar-v0',
    'Assault-v0',
    'Asterix-v0',
    'Asteroids-v0',
    'Atlantis-v0',
    'BankHeist-v0',
    'BattleZone-v0',
    'BeamRider-v0',
    'Berzerk-v0',
    'Bowling-v0',
    'Boxing-v0',
    'Breakout-v0',
    'Carnival-v0',
    'Centipede-v0',
    'ChopperCommand-v0',
    'CrazyClimber-v0',
    'DemonAttack-v0',
    'DoubleDunk-v0',
    'Enduro-v0',
    'FishingDerby-v0',
    'Freeway-v0',
    'Frostbite-v0',
    'Gopher-v0',
    'Gravitar-v0',
    'Hero-v0',
    'IceHockey-v0',
    'Jamesbond-v0',
    'JourneyEscape-v0',
    'Kangaroo-v0',
    'Krull-v0',
    'KungFuMaster-v0',
    'MontezumaRevenge-v0',
    'MsPacman-v0',
    'NameThisGame-v0',
    'Phoenix-v0',
    'Pitfall-v0',
    'Pong-v0',
    'Pooyan-v0',
    'PrivateEye-v0',
    'Qbert-v0',
    'Riverraid-v0',
    'RoadRunner-v0',
    'Robotank-v0',
    'Seaquest-v0',
    'Skiing-v0',
    'Solaris-v0',
    'SpaceInvaders-v0',
    'StarGunner-v0',
    'Tennis-v0',
    'TimePilot-v0',
    'UpNDown-v0',
    'Venture-v0',
    'VideoPinball-v0',
    'WizardOfWor-v0',
    'YarsRevenge-v0',
    'Zaxxon-v0',
    'CubeCrash-v0',
    'MemorizeDigits-v0']
```


```python
def get_image(env_id):
    try:
        env = gym.make(env_id)
        env.reset()
        for _ in range(10):
            _, _, done, _ = env.step(env.action_space.sample())
            if done:
                break
        image = env.render(mode='rgb_array')
        env.close()
    except:
        image = None
    return image
```


```python
images = {}
for env_id in (pbar := tqdm(selected_env_ids)):
    pbar.set_description(env_id)
    image = get_image(env_id)
    if image is not None:
        images[env_id] = image
```


    HBox(children=(HTML(value=''), FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=60.0), HTML(value='')))


    
    

Not all the images have the same resolution, so we look for the maximum width and height.


```python
max_width, max_height = 0, 0
for image in images.values():
    shape = image.shape
    max_width = max(max_width, shape[0])
    max_height = max(max_height, shape[1])
print(f"Maximum dimensions: {max_width} x {max_height}")
```

    Maximum dimensions: 250 x 160
    


```python
resized = []
font = ImageFont.truetype("font3270.otf", 20)

for env_id, image in images.items():
    image = Image.fromarray(image)
    image = image.resize((max_width, max_height))
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)
    draw.text((5,5), env_id, font=font)
    image = np.array(image)
    resized.append(image)
```


```python
resized = np.array(resized)
resized = resized.reshape(10, 6, max_height, max_width, 3)
```


```python
final = np.vstack([np.hstack(row) for row in resized])
```


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(24, 200))
plt.imshow(final)
plt.axis('off');
```

We now take one famous game, Ms PacMan, and we play using a random strategy. In another blog we'll see how to use more sophisticated methods, but for the moment we content ourselves with a nice visualization.


```python
env = gym.make('MsPacman-v0')
```

For this game we have nine discrete actions, as we can see with the command `env.unwrapped.get_action_meanings()`. The actions are `NOOP`,  `UP`, `RIGHT`, `LEFT`, `DOWN`, `UPRIGHT`, `UPLEFT`, `DOWNRIGHT`, `DOWNLEFT`.


```python
observations = []
font = ImageFont.truetype("font3270.otf", 12)
rewards = []
observations.append(env.reset())
done = False
while not done:
    observation, reward, done, _ = env.step(env.action_space.sample())
    rewards.append(reward)
    # add some text to the observation image
    image = Image.fromarray(observation)
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)
    text = f"step {len(rewards)}, reward: {int(sum(rewards))}"
    draw.text((5, 195), text, font=font)
    observations.append(np.array(image))
    if done:
        break
print(f"Number of steps: {len(rewards)}, final reward = {sum(rewards)}")
```

    Number of steps: 623, final reward = 220.0
    


```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import animation
from IPython.display import HTML

# np array with shape (frames, height, width, channels)
video = np.array(observations[:]) 

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 10))
im = plt.imshow(video[0,:,:,:])
plt.axis('off')
plt.close() # this is required to not display the generated image

def init():
    im.set_data(video[0,:,:,:])

def animate(i):
    im.set_data(video[i,:,:,:])
    return im

anim = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, init_func=init, frames=video.shape[0],
                               interval=50)
```


```python
anim.save('./atari-video.mp4')
```


```python
from IPython.display import Video

Video('./atari-video.mp4')
```

Another way of experimenting with these environments is to use [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org). The result isn't very good, but it shows what the game is and allows a human to play it.
