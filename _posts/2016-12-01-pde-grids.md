In this article we look at how to construct non-uniform grids for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). We follow the methodology presented in the book [Pricing Financial Instruments: The Finite Difference Method](https://www.amazon.com/Pricing-Financial-Instruments-Finite-Difference/dp/0471197602) by Domingo Tavella and Curt Randall, chapter 5. The focus is on PDEs approximated by means of a [finite difference method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method) on simple domains. By 'simple' we mean that the computational domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is a product of one-dimensional intervals, $\Omega = [x_{1, min}, x_{1, max}] \times x_{2, min}, x_{2, max}] \times \cdots \times x_{d, min}, x_{d, max}]$, with each $x_{i, min}$ and $x_{i, max}$ the minimal and maximal coordinate along the $i-th$ dimension. In this case the grid is the product of the PDE grid on each dimension; it will then suffice to consider the grid construction on a given axis, which is what we will do. We will drop the $i$ index for simplicity of notation, so $x_{min}$ and $x_{max}$ will be the minimual and maximal value of the grid we aim to construct.

Without loss of generality, we assume $0 = \xi_1 < \xi_1 < \ldots < \xi_n = 1$ to be a uniform discretization, and $g: [x_{min}, x_{max}] \rightarrow [0, 1]$ a transformation function that maps the uniform coordinates $\xi_i$ into the non-uniform one $x_i$. We write

$$
\frac{d x(\xi)}{d\xi} = g'(\xi),
$$

where $g'(\xi)$ tells us how much the grid changes at any given point. By modeling $g'$ we can aim to control the location of the points in the non-uniform grid. Any positive function will do it; our choice will depend on the grid we aim to have.

The most common case is where we have one point, $x^\star$ around which we want to concentrate the points. In this case a convenient choice for $g'(\xi)$ is

$$
g'(\xi) = A \sqrt{\alpha^2 + (x(\xi) - x^\star)^2},
$$

where $A$ is a constant to be determined, $\alpha$ is a prescribed uniformity parameter, and $x^\star$ is the point around which we want to concentrate the grid points. If $|x - x^\star| \gg \alpha$, the effective grid spacing is proportional to $x$ (that is, it is logarithmic), however if $|x - x^\star| \ll \alpha$ then the effective grid spacing is nearly uniform and rougly equal to $\alpha$.

The equation

$$
\frac{d x(\xi)}{d\xi} = A \sqrt{\alpha^2 + (x(\xi) - x^\star)^2}
$$

can be integrated easily,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{\alpha^2 + (x - x^\star)^2}} & = A \int d \xi \\
%
\sinh^{-1}\left( \frac{x - x^\star}{\alpha} \right) & = \xi A + C.
\end{aligned}
$$

The two constants $A$ and $C$ can be computed by imposing the boundary conditions $x(0) = x_{min}$ and $x(1) = x_{max}$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sinh^{-1}\left( \frac{x_{min} - x^\star}{\alpha} \right) & = C \\
%
\sinh^{-1}\left( \frac{x_{max} - x^\star}{\alpha} \right) & = A + C.
\end{aligned}
$$

Using

$$
\begin{aligned}
c_1 & = \sinh^{-1}\left( \frac{x_{min} - x^\star}{\alpha} \right) \\
%
c_2 & = \sinh^{-1}\left( \frac{x_{max} - x^\star}{\alpha} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

we obtain

$$
x(\xi) = x^\star + \alpha \sinh^{-1} \left( c_1(\xi - 1) + c2 \xi \right),
$$

which is the form we will test. The implementation is straightforward.


```python
import matplotlib.pylab as plt
import numpy as np 
import scipy as sp
```


```python
class SinhTransformation:
    
    def __init__(self, x_min, x_max, x_star, α):
        assert x_star >= x_min and x_star <= x_max
        assert α > 0
        self.x_min = x_min
        self.x_max = x_max
        self.x_star = x_star
        self.α = α
        self.c_1 = np.arcsinh((self.x_min - self.x_star) / self.α)
        self.c_2 = np.arcsinh((self.x_max - self.x_star) / self.α)

    def __call__(self, ξ):
        assert np.all(ξ >= 0)
        assert np.all(ξ <= 1)
        return self.x_star + self.α * np.sinh(self.c_2 * ξ + self.c_1 * (1 - ξ))
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"x_min: {self.x_min}, x_max={self.x_max}, x_*={self.x_star}, α={self.α}"
```


```python
ξ_grid = np.linspace(0, 1, 25)
```


```python
def plot_grid(t):
    x_grid = t(ξ_grid)
    for ξ, x in zip(ξ_grid, x_grid):
        plt.vlines(x=ξ, ymin=t.x_min, ymax=x, color='grey')
        plt.hlines(y=x, xmin=0, xmax=ξ, color='salmon')
    plt.plot(ξ_grid, x_grid, '-o')
    plt.axis('square')
    plt.xlabel('Uniform Grid (ξ)')
    plt.ylabel('Stretched Grid (x)')
    plt.title(str(t))
```

As expected, when $\alpha=$ the grid is almost uniform (though not exactly uniform). On the X-axis we report the uniform grid, indicated by $\xi$ and defined between 0 and 1; the the Y-axis we have the non-uniform grid, indicated by $x$ and defined between $x_{min}$ and $x_{max}$.


```python
plot_grid(SinhTransformation(x_min=1, x_max=2, x_star=1.4, α=1))
```

With $\alpha=0.1$ the non-uniformity increases, with points concentrated around $x^\star=1.4$.


```python
plot_grid(SinhTransformation(x_min=1, x_max=2, x_star=1.4, α=0.1))
```


    
![png](/assets/images/pde-grids/pde-grids-2.png)
    


Using $\alpha=0.05$ makes the non-uniformity even more prominent.


```python
plot_grid(SinhTransformation(x_min=1, x_max=2, x_star=1.4, α=0.05))
```

Another case it to have more points around which we want to concentrate the grid. This case is less straightforward.


```python
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp
from scipy.optimize import root
```


```python
class CompositeTransformation:

    def __init__(self, x_star_all, α_all):
        self.x_star_all = x_star_all
        self.α_all = α_all
    
    def __call__(self, ξ, x, A):
        total = 0.0
        for x_star, α in zip(self.x_star_all, self.α_all):
            total += np.power(α**2 + (x - x_star)**2, -2)
        return A * np.power(total, -0.5)
    
    def __str__(self):
        retval = []
        for x_star, α in zip(self.x_star_all, self.α_all):
            retval.append(f'{x_star}/{α}')
        return ', '.join(retval)
```


```python
composite = CompositeTransformation([0.2, 0.8], [0.1, 0.1])
```


```python
def compute_grid(A):
    sol = solve_ivp(composite, [0, 1], [0], t_eval=np.linspace(0, 1, 1000), args=(A,))
    return sol.y[0]

result = root(lambda A: compute_grid(A)[-1] - 1, [0.1])
assert result.success, result.message
A = result.x[0]
ξ_grid = np.linspace(0, 1, 50)
sol = solve_ivp(composite, [0, 1], [0], t_eval=ξ_grid, args=(A,))
x_grid = sol.y[0]

for ξ, x in zip(ξ_grid, x_grid):
    plt.vlines(x=ξ, ymin=0, ymax=x, color='grey')
    plt.hlines(y=x, xmin=0, xmax=ξ, color='salmon')
plt.plot(ξ_grid, x_grid, '-o')
plt.axis('square')
plt.xlabel('Uniform Grid')
plt.ylabel('Stretched Grid')
plt.title(str(composite));
```
